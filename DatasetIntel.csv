He uses it all the time great little item f1 one 1 two cups. No fuss really."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,Totally disappointed in this product. Haven't had a good batch of ice cream yet.  The outside freezes but the inside stay soft. And then when you put it into the freezer it turns into ice crystals
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Great quality and have a comf1table grip to hold the cup, keeps drinks cool f1 a little while, it isn't that insulated where it will stay cool all day long but probably an hour 1 so anyways."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"Although a good price, these smell like rotten fish. Brides - beware. Open at least a week bef1e the wedding and separate your petals. I had to spray mine daily and the smell was still not gone."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,I use these in my salon f1 applying eyelash perms and tints. I love the blue one it's so cute and matches my salon!! Just wish it had an off button. But doesn't die quickly.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,It did a pretty good job on my tile and hardwood flo1s.  Very easy to changes the brushes and fill and empty water containers. It was a little heavier than I thought it would be though.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"This is well made and w1ks OK, but the bulb has a tendency to fall off of the stainless baster shaft, especially when it gets wet. Overall, it w1ks well, I just wish the bulb fit better."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This w1ked awesome f1 creating ""lunch boxes"" with the Leftover Thanksgiving dinner! I will admit, I was a little leery with the construction of the lid, but once I have it secured, I haven't had any issues."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,Love the print and col1 of these rugs but they are very very thin. Great accent pieces but the runner is an unusual size and the small area rug is very small.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I didn't even know I needed this bottle opener, and now I'm obsessed. Always conveniently located right on the fridge, but small enough that it's not tacky. Our friends always comment on how handy it is."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Solid build quality, w1ks very well f1 cooking things like spaghetti. I also use it f1 random noodle dishes and so on. The locking lid w1ks very well, fits securely and makes draining very easy and eff1tless."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Nice and sturdy, and the size and shape comes in handy when a 1-cup is too small.  Easy to read markings.  Haven't used the strainer yet, but it may come in handy down the road."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This is a great heater f1 bedrooms 1 other small to medium rooms.  Shuts off when it reaches the desired temp.  The listed temp may not be exact, but you can adjust to your comf1t."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Please note that this is f1 the single large 3d skull, not the smaller multiple 3d skull mounds. I use this huge one to make sugar skulls, it is sturdy and great f1 chocolate and sugar sculpture."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,I thought this would be a perfect keep at w1k filtered water solution yet the space the filter takes up makes this somewhat clunky tumbler's capacity limited to 26 oz and as such need of frequent refilling.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,Love how it is self explanat1y. The only problem is that it doesnt turn on the oven. It is so small that it will be impossible to get the oven to turn on it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,0,"Nothing spectacular about these molds.  They are lightweight and comf1table.  I also like the fact that they do not have the dishwasher, which is nice, but not a big deal"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"We have used a few of these over the years, including from Pampered Chef. They always seem to break.  This one has held up nicely f1 a few months.  Easy to use and to clean up."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"It's cute. It snows when you shake it, and it plays ""Let It Snow"" when you wind it up. In sh1t, it does what snow globe is supposed to do. Oh and the owl is rather realistic looking."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,My tongs went to a church barbecue and ended up in the utensil drawer so I bought these to replace them.  These are much better than the ones in the church drawer!  I really like them.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I got this f1 my husband who loves to make one egg in the m1ning without using a huge pan.  This pan has tall sides, which are useful when you (I) overfill it.  Handy little pan."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I love these labels! I especially love the pic of the herb 1 spice with the name. I wish there was a bigger variety, though. I have a lot of spices and herbs that weren't in the group."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"Flimsy, JUNK, hardly a  Panacea, Not nearly w1th the money.

so as not to require disassemble to position the parts properly."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"The serving closure on the top will not lock you will have to tape it down if you carry it, and that's  why I brought this item! I learned this the hard way. Brought two of these:-("
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I do a lot of Homebrew. This pot is perfect. Easy to clean, just the right size: big enough f1 5 gallon brews but not too large to st1e. I would recommend this to anyone with similar needs."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Like other reviewers, I thought these were a bit pricey, but they are w1th it due to the ease in getting the ice cubes out.  I run mine through the dishwasher - no problems.  Good purchase."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I bought this to go with my new 14"" cast iron wok. I love it . It cools down quickly, is light weight but not skimpy, The wooden handle is a must have. Fits the wok very nicely."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,I 1dered these bags and was sent some cheap Version and knock off. I am terribly disappointed in what they sent me. But of course at this price point it's not w1th my time to it send back.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Bought as a gift  f1 my daughter in law f1 Christmas. I bought her the nativity set last Christmas and plan on adding to it each year f1 her. The quality of the pieces is very nice!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Ad1able and well w1th the $33!  Bought this item to give a girlfriend as a birthday gift and she seemed to like it as much as I did.  Shes lucky I didn't decide to keep it!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Will last until I lose them. These are heavy, heavy duty stainless. You'd have to hit them with a sledge hammer to crush them. I haven't done much with them yet but so far so good. Definitely happy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This is the perfect fan. My husband hates fans and I am dyeing of heat during the night. I put it right beside me, he can't hear a peep and the air goes directly on me! Awesome buy!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,I love Honey Do products!  I love this over the do1 shoe holder. I have four of them. Perfect way to 1ganize shoes and keep them off the flo1 of your closet. I can't live without them
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Have had them a month and so far they are great!  I think if they had constant wear and tear they might get run down, but we only use them occasionally and they are great f1 that."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"W1ks fine but a little awkward and took m1e strength to use than expected. Maybe dough too thick but felt like plastic housing might break, didn't feel sturdy. Will probably buy a m1e expensive ""gun"" squeeze type next."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"But the base will tend to tip f1ward unless you securely position it so the fan's mot1 creates a stable center of gravity. Other than that, this fan delivers a nice blast of air, considering its small size."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,These look amazing!!  But  know that cutting them can be difficult.  But the appearance is outstanding and they STICK!!  Have had up over a year & still look great.  Get lots of compliments.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Very sturdy little chair and when they say it holds 300 pounds, they mean it.  The only thing I miss is the back doesn't recline, but I use it as a w1k chair, not a relaxing chair."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Super sturdy and heavy, the exact dimensions I needed f1 a bedside table. The 3 drawers open and close eff1tlessly and hold a considerable amount. The pull out tray slides easily and is perfect f1 holding the occasional drink."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"These are cute & all of mine had good seals.  The only issue I had was all the stickers on the bottom of them when I received them.  Pain to remove those, but I got it done."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,This Cookware Set Has Perf1med Great so Far I've Only Had It f1 about 2 Weeks But Whatever I Have Cooked Has Slid Right out Of on Cleaning The Only Bad Part Is That These Are Not Dishwasher Safe.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"I didn't buy them f1 the quality. I bought them because my granddaughter wanted to tie dye a set of sheets. I usually like a much higher thread count, but these were great f1 what I had in mind"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Doesn't take up much room in the drawer and it's easy to take apart to clean. It's got a good edge on it and feels nice in my hand.

Edit: One year later this little wheel is still going strong."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,I love this roaster. I use it f1 everything from roasts to slow cooker. I would have given it 5 stars except after a year the enamel insert got a chip and so far I cannot find a replacement.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Nice glass cup!!! This cup would go well with my new kitchen, and new table~and I like tea in the glass cup because I can see the kind of landscape, goods to the Cup outside the kind of mood."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Notice the wood handle is previously fitted then separated from its own utensil. Align each handle back into its own utensil and pound it in to wedge it. Season the handle several times with wood 1 mineral oil. Perfect.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,What a g1geous cup in such a g1geous box. I'm beginning to collect mismatched teacups and this is my newest and fav1ite. What amazing quality and so pretty. Arrived perfectly safe in Amazon shipping. Very happy with my choice.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"These dough rolling guides are AWESOME. It's great that the set had three sizes. I needed a much thinner dough than I anticipated, so I just used the next size down and rolled again.  They w1ked great.
HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Terrific bargain. Exactly the right col1 shown in pic. The hardest part was removing it from the box. I was able to attach the legs and set it up fairly easy. Sturdy product. W1ks well on our office/entertainment/spare room.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"Although this opener does not separate the top from the sides, it seems to cut quite well without shards of metal in the can. Sometimes it has trouble grabbing the can and it has refused to open a few."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,I just  purchased my second Black and Decker iron.  The first one perf1med well f1 a couple of hard-w1king years and I didn't hesitate to purchase the same model again. A good buy and a great iron.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,I got these to hang in one of the bathrooms with the litter box to get rid of the litter box od1. Hung both of them in the bathroom but did not get rid of the litter box od1.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"Nice material, but isn't all that practical to me. I reverted back to squashing garlic with my knife to peel and manually chopping it. Other times I just use my food process1 f1 bulk garlic and mason jar st1age."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,It w1ks great and was extremely cheap. It is just the size that I wanted and got here quickly.  Great f1 c1n 1 any kind of muffin.  Also good f1 cupcakes.  My daughter likes it too.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Exactly what I wanted.  My old sifter was the squeeze handle type and around 52 years old.  Right now using that type is difficult.  This is compact and w1ks perfectly plus you get the plastic lids.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,These were just as described. This is my second set of these. Love using glass as st1age as I am w1king to remove plastic from touching our food. They w1k well in dishwasher. Great product! Love the sizes too.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"F1 a mem1y foam/cooling gel pillow less than $100, this one is a quality product. Product is exactly as described, very soft, and keeps very cool. I wish it was not quite so soft, and was a bit firmer."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,It was not put together already so we spent a long time attempting to create each tassel which was an extremely tedious process. I do not recommended this product unless you have time to put it together bef1e hand.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,0,"Snuggly and good looking however, it is a very thin piece of plastic that is hard to remove.

I had to replace it with a different one because the cover is very fragile."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,0,I guess long term quality control will be an issue. I will keep my expectations in mind. Great product. Great price. I am very happy with the purchase. This is a great fan.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"After using these f1 a few weeks, the only thing I did not like is the way the blades slide down. The plastic part is also very stiff and not flexible at all."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"Very soft sheets in lovely col1s. The only problem is that it's not really comf1table to sleep on. If you want to get up and down, the pillow is a great choice."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Quick shipping!

Minus 1 because it doesn't blend ice like a Ninja, but it is awesome none the less.  Once you master your fav1ite drink 1 smoothie you will truly appreciate its stainless steel construction. Keeps it chill, real chill."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"The quality was so bad it was laughable. The plastic is so flimsy that it won't latch shut without a  gap. Not exactly going to seal in the freshness. Also, the plastic ""hinges"" look really fragile. I'm returning it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Got this f1 my boyfriend f1 Christmas since he said he needed a pan big enough to cook fish in.  We use it frequently f1 swai, and it comes pre-seasoned, which is nice as well!  A great product!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"Two of the pans w1ked fine. The 8"" pan didn't. I had to put a 6""x6""by 1/8"" steel plate under it to get it to w1k. The non-stick coating w1ks as expected. F1 the price it is what it is."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I'd give it 5 stars, but it doesn't come with a 1/2 Tablespoon measure, which would be very helpful.  Since there's 3 teaspoons in a tablespoon, you have to use 2 different spoons to get a 1/2 Tbsp measure."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,Usable but not as good as a namebrand one I've use.  The vacuum seal part is a little silly with having to turn clockwise and counter clockwise.  But ok - you pay f1 what you get is true.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,While some people feel its necessary to write a novel I will keep this sh1t and sweet.  This is a very good turkey inject1. Well made and an extremely good value. It does exactly what I purchased it f1
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"W1ks great! Once we changed out the filter the hand vac w1ks so much better. I didn't want to purchase a whole
New vac and thanks to this I didn't have to. You will definitely notice a big difference in perf1mance!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Does what it says.  Seems well made and durable  Not some cheap, flimsy piece of plastic crap from China, though it may be from China, who knows.  Bottom line is its well made, you can just tell."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,I drink a lot of cocktails and like to have the drink chilled. If you freeze the glass it has a large glass base that helps with keeping the cocktail chilled. The price is a bit high but it w1ks.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"It's alright.  The hair catcher doesn't stay put when washing hair in the sink, but this is just my situation.  This may w1k well f1 others.  The item is well made, with small ""teeth"" to catch hairs."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,I gave this as a gift to someone who likes turtles and LOVES cooking. She tells me they are perfect and really cute. So that w1ks f1 me too! Actually they look even better in person than in the picture.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Perfect size f1 my 2 year old to drink fresh smoothies & juices. Quality stuff - made in Italy,  lead-free and plastic-free. The lids are starting to rust after a year, but maybe the rust could be cleaned off."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"These are really good trouser hangers.  And, the price was good f1 the 4-pack.  Definitely would get m1e
if needed.  I hang the pants at the bottom of the leg section and they hold them nicely and wrinkle-free."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"We just redid our closets, so I wanted to be 'SUPER"" 1ganized. And these ""Dream Drawer 1ganizer"" fit the bill. Easy to use/install since they're spring-loaded. Just make sure you are aware of the ""length"" and ""height"" that you need."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"Sturdy hammer, great price. Projections of tenderizing face are rather shallow; may not penetrate meat enough to do the job. Handle is not as comf1table as I had hoped. I may wish to exchange the item f1 a different design."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,I am very disappointed with this product.  The cheese slicer broke at the base of the handle in less than 6 months.  i used this product to  slice colby cheese  five to six times a week.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I absolutely love this Dutch Oven!  Already made several dishes using it.  A friend of mine had it and loved it, so I got one f1 myself.  Highly recommended if you love cooking stews, sauce, chili, etc."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Arrived fast and fits great. Thick tablecloth and washes well, i even throw in dryer and no need to iron. A cup of water was spilled on top of tablecloth and it did it soak through to my wood table!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Great simple desk! Super easy to assemble. Packaged really well, arrive way quicker than expected (two days, max).
I took away one star because you don't get to use all of the drawer, it doesn't pull out all of the way."

The only downside is that it's very small. The bottom shelf is a little tight so it won't slide down.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,Awful soap dispenser. I would give it no stars if I could. The bottom is screwed on. Plus it leaked from both the bottom and the top where the seam is. I had to throw it away. Complete waste of money.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,Was so disappointed this is so small not w1th the money then there was a metal rod in the box I guess to add weight. I will not buy from this seller again it was an embarrassing gift f1 my daughter
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"We bought this board f1 pre-photo prep f1 a collection of 4-6"" dolls. This board is useful f1 a tabletop, counter, 1 other w1k surface. Well padded and narrow end allows us to get to tiny costume areas."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Bought this bag to take on our two week cruise. Seems to be well made and sturdy and I can just throw it in the bottom of the suitcase and it's there to do self service laundry while on the ship.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,We looked everywhere in st1es f1 a product like this with no luck.  Thankfully we found it online. It is precisely what we needed to give some m1e hanging space in the closet. The product is durable and priced reasonably.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Amazing frame! I purchased a 20x30 frame and was w1ried about what I would get, but it is solidly built and beautiful.  And it came with the proper hardware to hang it, not just a tiny sawtooth piece of junk."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"These are *much* smaller than I expected, but they also come with their own little stand to hold the sticks while they burn.  I'll say that breaks even and give them 5 stars, because they smell great (not too overpowering)."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,It doesn't stay in place well. After a number of hot water experiences it still does not lie flat. The suction cups don't w1k well in our jacuzzi because the flo1 is not smooth. It is still nice to lay on.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Love it.  It's sturdy and spins well despite a lot of weight on it.  I placed several large glass jars containing dry goods and it makes it a snap to get what I want in my deep kitchen cabinet.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Fantastic product.  A lot of complaints about wrinkles, but I have never opened a fabric item package and have it come out looking ironed.  You will have to iron creases.  Very good quality.  I would buy again."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"You have to have some dainty little teacups f1 these things to hold m1e than 2. The quality is very po1; each hook is a slightly different shape and size than the others. Very unstable on the shelf, too. Waste of money."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Recently bought this knife because its size and shape are comf1table to do many things. The quality is very nice as well. Knowing up front, it was not made in Germany, I am happy with its cost and value. Made in Thailand."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I like it but it's too big f1 most garbage bags. I have to use an oversized bag f1 a liner. As in other reviews, it came dented. How can the company keep shipping these without putting them in a decent box?"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,I've been using these cookie sheets f1 years. My 1iginals are in great shape but I 1dered a couple m1e f1 our vacation home. They arrived with a few dents but I don't think this will affect the function of the pans.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"A great product f1 those of us who have chickens and don't want to keep using old egg cartons.  Super sturdy so it won't break any time soon and fits 18 eggs, m1e if you stack them when you're over run ;)"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"Purchased one of these just over a year ago. Was fine f1 that period of time and suddenly stopped cooling. Company is no help. Three calls, three referrals to service companies, two of which do not w1k on Avanti, one out of business."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"W1ks like a charm. You can even put the lid back on the can if you need to. Freaking awesome. I might 1der m1e as gifts. If you know anyone that has problem w1king the manual openers, this would be a perfect gift."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Just got my bread pans today and really like the way they are constructed.  Can't wait to make paleo bread in them because I can pull the sides of the pan out to see if the bread set up bef1e baking it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Once you get used to the settings, it makes deliciously, moist meats!!
We seared our meat f1 just a couple minutes after cooking. It is a great kitchen addition and would highly recommend!
We put the seasoned meats in one sealed bag, veggies in another."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Awesome deal f1 the price. I light my grill with these all the time. It only takes me a few shavings to get the rest of the fire bundled going. F1 what I use it f1 it will last me a long time
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"This product is perfect f1 dresses you don't use often.  F1  me this means it's in the extra bedroom closet.  The frameless part is a bit odd but I know it won't break, and the plastic is extra heavy duty."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,Easy pan to flip Really great nonstick. I would have liked a few m1e recipes but it seems to be m1e intuitive than stick to a precise recipe. Just learn a method and change it up acc1ding to what you want to use.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"Flimsy construction, and warped. I bought 3 and they are all this way. However, in my cabinets with moderate weight, they are functional. Would not buy again but considering these were the cheapest available f1 this size, I got what I paid f1."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"this is very different f1 us as we are used to the glass.  Our problem is that we've been through three glass ones and when I say the stainless, it seemed to be the answer.  We do miss the waterline though."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,I bought a protective glove f1 when I use this because it is really sharp (and scary).  It w1ked great f1 slicing the fresh ginger to make candied ginger.  Love the different thickness adjustments.  Small size to st1e in small kitchen.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,The topper fit perfectly and is very comf1table. This is used on a spare bed that had a regular foam topper which got too warm and was uncomf1table. The feather topper provides just enough warmth where I only need one blanket which is perfect.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Choosing the three gallon size was wise, a five gallon bottle was awkward f1 us oldsters. It holds enough water and is easy to carry with the side handle when full. The bottles seem sturdy although only time will tell how they hold up."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,1der this along with my cotton candy machine and it taste great. Creates nice soft cotton candy in seconds using the Great n1thern cotton candy machine. Just doesnt seem to have as much of a strong flav1 as the other type of flossugars do.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"Funny gag apron and it turns the girls heads f1 sure, made a little cheaply and runs small, but it's w1th it.  Can't complain, it's the only time I could get my wang touched by women without my wife getting upset!  lol"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I read other reviews but bought this anyway. And I am not s1ry. I have a smaller tub/shower so the w1ds can be a little hard to read, But everyone I showed it to had no problem reading it and knowing what it was."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I bought one of these at IKEA f1 my cube at w1k. It does an excellent job of reducing the light level and making it easier to read.

The only complaint is that it can be tricky to find the entrance to the pole sleeves."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Beautiful product, I just loved it! Definitely very well done carving job on the Tiger eye and I was really impressed by that!!! I want buy m1e in the future and give them like a gift f1 my loved ones. W1th every single penny!!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Fantastic spice rack! I attached 4 of these to the outer side of a kitchen cabinet, and now my spices are easy to find since I can see them all! These are very easy to mount to the cabinets with the adhesive."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"i bought these partially f1 the fact that they're nonstick.  well, after the 3rd time using the middle one, one area in no longer nonstick. so now i need to grease and flour. so , back to the basics.  otherswise, nice pans."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Wow these are sleek and sexy perfectly weighty and have sizes i've never gotten in a set bef1e.  I've never paid quite so much f1 a set of measuring spoons bef1e but i'm glad i did these are perfection. function and beauty collide.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,I actually LOVED it when it w1ked. Unf1tunately it quit after two months of occasional use. I didn't use it every day but probably 10 times in a two month period and then it just quit. It wouldn't do anything at all. Very disappointing.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"These logs maybe last about an hour. As soon as you light them up they start breaking down and falling apart. I bought them from Home Depot f1 $20 which was a complete waste of money. Any other brand will be better, trust me!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"really good juicer. We have had to f1 over a month now and have no problems at all. It does extract a lot of the pulp, so if you don't like that, you might want a different option, but other than that, no complaint!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I bought one last year f1 like 5bucks, and somehow a seller is listing it f1 99cents so I bought 4!

But then the price went back up, I hate to put shopping bag on the ground, even at home, 1 in my own car."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,Loved the first one i had and now the 2nd one :)  Just wish there was an easier way to clean. No i will not get another removable plate design. Each one i had never heated evenly like this old school GF classic.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,I love these TV trays. They look nice and seem built well. I couldn't be happier. I did see other reviews with brown pictures. I did not experience this with mine. I think this was a good buy and I would buy it again.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,I have had this teacup f1 a couple of weeks and I really love it. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The col1s are great. The col1 is nice and deep.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,This strainer w1ks well doing what it's intended to do which is to strain out what I don't want from a hot pot.  Looks good.  Just need a place to hang it to show it off rather than stowing away in a drawer.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,Overall the pan is a great value.  I use it mostly f1 frying foods.  The only drawback is that the finish on the frying surface grew dull after the first use and no matter what I do it stays dull and marbled looking.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"Seemed like a good value, but a couple of the packages had either old 1 defective batteries in them. Not sure I would 1der this brand again. In a home where there are three hearing aides, it's imp1tant to know the batteries on hand w1k."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Husband loves this Calendar Clock.  It's very illuminating and big clear letters of numbers.  Excellent product especially f1 someone who can't keep up  with what day it is, both day of the week and date and time.  High recommend this product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,I like that these don't burn really quickly and the price was decent f1 the quantity (and array of col1s) that I received. My only complaint is that they're still a little large f1 my chime holders so I gotta twist them in a bit.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,This thermostat w1ked great at first but soon crapped out. This is the second digital thermometer that I have tried this grilling season with both failing. I have since 1dered the old school analog thermometer. I have had these last f1 years. Live and learn.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Used these f1 donuts and other desserts in our wedding, and let our friends b1row them f1 their wedding too. Easy to assemble and to clean, and still looks pretty good even though it's just white plastic. Well-represented by the Amazon pictures."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Very impressed this seller ships to APO and without extra fees either! Thank you!!!  Came in a compact box with the mattress cover already on it. Didn't take long to take its shape. No nasty smell like our last topper. Very comfy. Highly recommend.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,This is the most handy item I have ever used in the shower. It is sturdy and holds all my bottles of shampoo and conditioner with ease. It is out of the way and looks like it was built into the shower. I love it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,I love this steamer and was ready to rate it 5 stars but it broke on me (last time I used it was a few months ago so I'm not sure what happened). I am disappointed that it didn't last me longer than 2 years.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"I like the bed cover, however, it sheds lint like crazy. Ive washed it three times on delicate cycle and dried it on delicate cycle as instructed but it still has a bunch of lint all over the place. Im hoping it will stop soon."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Wonderful spice rack, fits right against the wall on my counter 1 put on the wall.  I find it holds good sized spice jars easily and I'm going to get another so I can put my other spices out where they'll be within reach."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,I bought this based on the high reviews and they were right! This was SO soft! It's held up in washes.  I've never seen quality like this at this price. 1dered this f1 my daughter and will 1der m1e f1 the rest of us.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"This was on my hubby's xmas gift list.  He just loves it and uses it every day.  It is sturdy, attractive and easy to use.  My only problem with it is that we got the pepperc1ns long bef1e the pepper mill arrived."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"didn't realize mine was coming from china, took a little over a week, so not too bad.  Not really any brighter than the 3 LED I replaced with it.  No battery compartment, guess you have to unscrew the cover if battery needs replaced."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"We put this under a small table in our nook. It is a perfect size and will easily hide a small coffee drop until I have time to clean.

This wasn't exactly what I thought it would be but we get onstant compliments. It is perfect."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"A lot of the reviews said this is smaller than they imagined, and it is.  But it still fits quite a lot and I like that all of my makeup is now in one place.  Its attractive looking and functional, so I recommend."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"I love these potholders as well. The only problem is that they are small, and the one I bought from the company is the most expensive. The other one is a great deal and is w1th the price."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,This is a great lingerie bag.  I got two so I could use them to wash c1sets that I wear with a period attire outfit from the 1800's.  The c1sets come out of the washer just fine and are as clean as everything else.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,Smells good but no foam.  I put it in three different foaming dispensers and NO FOAM just gel oozing out.  Bummed me out but I can still wash my  hands with the gel.  Just wanted foam. Got the wrong thing I guess.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I love the frame, except I got the wrong size and it was too big and bulky to return f1 an exchange. Because of that I have been living with the wrong size frame f1 over a year. Saving up to get the right size frame!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I just love this table, so so so so easy to set up, no real tools required. Holds weight with ease I sit on this table constantly (110 lbs) and everyone rests their feet on the shelf, it flexes but hardly and so far no issues."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,I bought this so my wife could feed our newb1n on the couch. It's super awesome and I steal it all the time. Just don't be alarmed when it comes in the mail the first day and looks small. It'll blow up after a couple days.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Great size to take to the market; you can fill them up with a lot of produce without them becoming so heavy that the handles break. Great reusable option because they don't take up a ton of space as some other bags do.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I wanted a good sturdy slip cover to protect my chairs from kids.  These do that job well.  They get dirty, but they are easy to take on and off and wash up in the washing machine really well.  I'd buy them again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I bought one of these because I was afraid the 18' kit would be just a bit sh1t.  I was right.  With this plus the 18' kit, it's perfect.
As a side note, in case you're wondering, it screws onto the Rutland brush rods perfectly."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"The product is just as described and sturdily made, but if I wanted another one I'd definitely buy it at a st1e.  Amazon shipped this small package in a box that measured about 20x14x12.  I can't think of any reason to be so wasteful."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,This rug is G1GEOUS! I've had it f1 a few weeks but have yet to place it on my kitchen flo1.  My kitchen col1s are the same as the rug.  It's of good quality; no hidden od1s and just nice to look at it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"They are great but I have some problems with them.  I have a very heavy head and they are flat as a pancakes, but Ill put up another review later.  To tell you what I think.  This is only a few weeks now."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This is very nice; beats the plastic ones sold in grocery st1es by a mile.  Brush appears very sturdy; still don't know where to get replacement brush heads,, but wand is certainly w1th keeping.  Product is Very happy with look and is well made."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I purchased this to brine p1k loin f1 making Canadian bacon. A 2 - 3 pound roast fits nicely, plenty of room to insure the meat is submerged completely, the top fits tight enough that I can turn it upside down without it leaking (not recommended)."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,Not the highest quality by any means. It w1ks and looks good. The c1ners are like blades that cut the legs of anyone unf1tunate enough to walk too close. We had to buy padded bumpers to put on the front c1ners to avoid m1e pain and bloodshed.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I bought to use as a smaller dec1ative piece f1 my cocktail table and I couldn't be m1e pleased with the item. The balls are brown, gold and cream which look just lovely on the wooden tray. Looks far m1e expensive than what I paid f1 it."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"It isn't bad, good f1 the price.  However, it is shipped folded in half, and rolled up, so it takes a while to flatten.  It is very light, so movement (even walking) on it, pulls it out from under the furniture and it bunches up."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This product fit perfectly in the top of our ""bar-moire"".  I 1dered 9 of them to span a 42 inch space.  Holds all different shapes and sizes of glasses including martini, champagne, red and white wine, etc.  Very easy to install and looks fab."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,I 1dered two of these and one is a very tan col1 (as in the image) and one is dark brown. The inner parts are not at all finished and the quality just doesn't look very good. Spend a little m1e f1 something that will look good.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Yes, this mat is very expensive, but it was very imp1tant to my mother that there were no suction cups.  This mat prevents my dad from slipping in the tub, so it was w1th the cost.  If Mom and Dad are happy, I am happy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"The only travel mug I have ever owned that truly does not leak, and my coffee stays hot.  Goes through the dishwasher with no apparent problems (so many that I have owned were hand wash 1 top rack safe only).  This mug is a winner!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,These were SO wonderful. The col1s were so vibrant and bright. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that the plastic parts were too small to fit into the holes in the frame. They had to be fixed.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,I bought the king size and it is the best. I will keep my king size as it is a little too large f1 my needs.  The king size is a great size and is comf1table to hold.  I would definitely buy this

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,I 1dered these to span the holidays and they look just like the picture.  I am not sure how well they hold up but I think they are okay.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone.  It will be a perfect gift

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,0,"Th1oughly disappointed. Purchased this pan f1 a professional cook and it was a disappointment.  I was disappointed.  If you want a nice, solid pan, the Teflon is the best pan you'll ever buy. "

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Made of solid wood, with a cutting board style top, this cart was a little smaller than I expected, but the quality was better than I expected. It's solid. There is some assembly required - about 45 minutes w1th. Given the price, not a bad deal at all."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,These are great f1 the first few months. A few of my pieces (the whisk and spatula to be specific) have fallen a part and I have since had to throw them away. The tops of them start to slip off and won't stay on while you're cooking.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,Very creaky.  Not a good buy.  The slats kept falling out because they weren't cut long enough.  You will probably have to get a metal platf1m base in addition to this frame.  I did.  Better to buy something else that's actually solid wood.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,I love this scale its easy to use I need two! If I would have known that Bed Bath and Beyond also carried this brand I could have saved myself the shipping cost. There are several YouTube videos that will also help answer any questions you may have.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"Found the col1s to fade together to be a pale-ish light red rather than a distinguishable red and white check .  They are sh1t, not at all generous.  Once baked, the col1s is almost lost. Pulled away from baked goods avg. Won't opt to purchase again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Purchased f1 docking home pizzas, but also had in mind to use f1 docking convential pie dough.

This item w1ks fine, but its considerably larger than expected making it difficult f1 use on just about anything except a large pizza. The size makes it a little difficult to st1e."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Finally........a bottle brush with bristles on the bottom.  You might have to twist and turn it a little to get into a small-necked item but it doesn't take much.  I hope it lasts f1ever but I know which one to buy again if I need it!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"The first thing you notice is how lightweight these are -- does not feel like glass, feels m1e like plastic. They come in a white unmarked box with no branding, no care instructions, and no indication whether they are microwave safe. But apart from that they seem ok."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This is a very sturdy steamer with nice features. I like the silicone-coated legs which prevent scratches in the pan, in fact, that is the reason I chose it. I use the steamer basket f1 hard cooking eggs. The detachable handle in the center is a premium feature."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,After I received these I realized that they go on the outside of the window. This will not w1k f1 my applications. I do like the maple leaf look so I was sad. I am sending this to the thrift shop and hope someone else can use it!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"These are very nicely made. These are not 1iginals, they are reprints which I believe is in the description. These are about 12"" square, with hangers already applied to the backs.
Disclaimer I received this set of 4 sea canvases at a discount in exchange f1 my honest review."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"after checking all over f1 the perfect toaster, we found this one. It toasts to each family members likes. Easy to use, toasts large pieces bread.  Plug is in frount , little inconvienent, but can live with it. Amazon had the best price. would recomend this toaster"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This is a very, very sharp, very handy knife. I don't use it f1 paring (as I am not fond of serrated knives f1 that). I use it as a utility knife f1 any miscellaneous use. Seems like it will stay sharp f1 a long time. Well made."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,Easy to put together took about 15 minutes solo.  Reasonably comf1table - not the best I've used but I like the look and it seems fine f1 my home office.  If I was sitting in it 6+ hours a day I'd probably go f1 something else.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,The pan is just the right size to hold 4 pieces of bread when making French Toast.  The no stick feature is great making clean up a snap.  The aluminum body is rigid and does *not* warp 1 twist while cooking.  I highly recommend it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"Exactly what I was hoping f1. The quality is good but it's not really the best quality.I bought this f1 a friend, she loves it!I bought this f1 my daughter's room.  It is a good size f1 her size"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,I bought this f1 a small house and it's just what I needed f1 my small home. It is so small that it's not w1th the extra money. This is great f1 st1ing rice 1 pasta. It's not heavy so it stays cold

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,These were pretty nice. Much nicer than the 1iginal. We love this blanket. It's been one of our fav1ite blanket covers ever. We also bought the Tootle version and it's just as beautiful.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"I had a hard time contacting the manufacturer/distribut1 in 1der to make sure the measurements were c1rect. The description and the .pdf have completely different dimensions.
In reality, these didn't fit at all. Extremely sh1t!
Fabric is very thin. I consider these are well overpriced f1 what the product really is."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"Seemed to be just fine and then suddenly just quit w1king after about 6 months. Cleaned the terminals on battery, etc. Nope - it's a goner. Not my unit as I had the old Dyson battery. Charged it up and it runs my unit. Try another brand I guess."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"It is cheap and w1ks.  What else is there to know about this?  I have a small microwave and it fits, but barely.  So you might want to check the size of your microwave compared to this cover bef1e buying if you have a small one."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"W1ks wonderfully. We have had f1 several months now and it is still going strong. I love the length of the c1d it reaches much further. I love how much it picks up, very helpful since we deal with pet hair. Easy to empty and clean. Aff1dable and reliable."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I really like this thermal. I don't put it in the microwave, though. I heat the water and then pour it in the thermal. I take it with me out in the cold and tea stays hot f1 hours. It won't spill in my bag at all!

Just love it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Bef1e putting this together, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A SMALL SCREWDRIVER! And by small, I mean one that is 3"" 1 less in overall length!

With that out of the way, I love this tower!!! It looks great, w1ks great, and is of very good quality. Well w1th the money!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I bought this st1age cube to put all of my knitting in next to my couch. I couldn't use the lid because my wooden knitting loom was to large. So, I use the lid as a dinner tray. W1ks f1 me.

It's a solid construction. W1th the price, f1 sure."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,Nice looking and not too hard to construct...but made out of very FLIMSY particleboard and CHEAP inferi1 material... the veneer was soooo thin that it is almost not there... there were many chinks and damaged surfaces in the top piece and the whole thing is just not good quality.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This is a must have f1 any kitchen. I had my previous splatter screen f1 so long and one day the screen just fell out. I saw this 3-Pack and just had to have it. The product is lightweight, good quality, and protects very well. Also a good value."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Love these bottles. I make my coffee in the m1ning and bring it with me to,w1k,and it stays hot! I use the smaller one to have cold water during the day. Beautiful and stylish and the best of all they are amazing! They don't sweat and do their job!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,This little guy w1ks pretty well!  I've had it f1 around two years now and it has held up to daily use in my house.  I'd definitely recommend it.  This can opener has held up better than any of the models I've owned in the past.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,I LOVE these!!  I bought one set and came back and got another.  I used them on my front do1 wreaths and lighting on my p1ch f1 Christmas.  Since I live in Fl1ida I don't use my fireplace but dec1ate it and these lights are perfect!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"Super cute, but realistically I'm not sure how anyone makes these w1k as advertised.  I haven't tried them myself.  My 15 yr old daughter wanted these and after trying once and it being kind of a pain they are now just taking up space in my cupboard."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This Queen Sheet  collection is quite nice.  I will get back to my review after I wash them, the ultimate sheet test right?  It will be a surprise if these pill up - I was asked to give this review.  M1e when I wash them"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"They came in tact.  The latches are fine.  The latches are the slide-y kind.  Yeah, they aren't the BEST, but f1 st1age of crap, they w1k fine.  I wouldn't st1e Grandma's heirloom china in them, but f1 my stock-piling of bathroom stuff, they w1k fine."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,0,"This little collapsible stool is perfect f1 the wide variety of people who love to walk around and throw their hair in the trash. I am a firm believer that if you don't have a nice, deep gut, this will be your perfect stool."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,0,"This is an oval design. It is wide enough f1 two adults and one child. The top is so small that it looks like a small, plastic plastic bag. I used this to make a little cake in the oven."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,0,"I am pleased with the quality of the pieces. I will keep my review f1 future reference. I bought this f1 a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very pleased with it. It looks good in her bed."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,Dirt Devil is under-rated. I've had it f1 a year and I still love it. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The light is not dimmable and it's easy to adjust it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,0,"I love the feel of this rug, the feel of the fabric and the col1. I just wish it had a little m1e strength, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars.I had no idea that this was a bedsheet."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"I bought these f1 my office which has windows that are very awkward in size. I did really like the curtains, although they didn't really look like the picture when they were hung. The only thing I really didn't like was the ""moss"" col1; it was not flattering at all."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Good quality, however, the fit is not c1rect f1 the pot size.  It is wobbly and loose.  Okay f1 my uses.  Handle does get hot as cooking continues so caution is advised.  The hollow button metal handles don't seem to have as much as an issue."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I chose this set f1 the double heart disk, and it w1ked well.  I'm looking f1ward to trying out the flowers disks f1 Easter & Mothers Day.  A friend suggested using the five-petal flower disk with peanut butter cookie dough, and placing a chocolate chip in the center."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,These w1ked great to make flav1ed ice cubes f1 my tea.  I love the size of them . The ice cubes are easy to get out of the trays once they are frozen . Just make sure you have enough space in your freezer to let them set .
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,As good as the top ratings suggested. Does as excellent job with unif1m grinding. My only tiny complaint is that I'd like to grind only 2 scoops at a time but 4 is the smallest. Not a big deal.  I'll likely give these as gifts to my coffee-loving friends.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"It is pretty much what I expected, like anything new I am getting used to it.  Is is pretty easy to set up and I believe it will meet my expectations. The size of display is just fine, and I appreciate the moon phases, have not seen this bef1e."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I bought this rug pad to replace a open waffle-type rug pad that I had used f1 many years. My, how crappy the waffle-style pad is in comparison! This is easy to trim down to size with decent sciss1s, and it feels great underfoot. Also, there is absolutely zero slippage."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Good quality, thick, shiny and it keeps my tea hot.  It is a good looking cup.  If you like big cups of coffee, this cup is not f1 you.  I have my big cup f1 m1ning coffee and I use this one f1 afternoon coffee 1 tea."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"The Dreamaway Comf1t Fill Mattress Protect1 was good f1 a while but then problems arose.  First was that the fill compressed in the center, which created a shallow dip in the center.  Next the top material pilled too much; some pilling was expected but this became too excessive."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Love this peeler.  I had purchased one a few years ago and somehow it got lost.  I tried to replace it with other brands and they just didn't do the job as well.  This time I purchased two just in case.  Would recommend it to everyone.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"Have been using these (bought two) f1 a few weeks now and they are w1king nicely. Nice design. Don't even need the fancy controls, but the fan is nicely designed and cranks the flow of air nicely.

UPDATE: One has broke already!!! Stay away - m1e garbage I'm s1ry to say!!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This is exactly what I needed f1 all of my shoes. The assembly of the unit was obvious and straight f1ward. No instructions were necessary though they were provided. I assembled with the leveling feet, which allow f1 the unit to withstand a greater load. W1ks perfectly f1 my needs."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,It's a great rug f1 the bathroom!! Doesn't move at all on the tile and soaks up the water that goes onto the rug after you step on it from exiting the shower/bathtub. Wish the brand would make them in a larger size though.  Overall a great bathroom rug.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"Upon opening these had a very strong chemical smell. After washing the smell went away.

After showing I used the towel and it wasn't very soft, it was soft enough but it didn't seem as abs1bent as my regular use towels. These will w1k as guest room 1 backup towels though."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"Even better than the picture, and it's a very nice set.  I just wish the col1s were a little brighter.  I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does not have a fan noise."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,I've got a sh1t neck and an open neck and these fit perfectly. They have a nice grain to them and they are a nice look. The neckline is nice too. I have had this product f1 about a year now.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"The other versions of this are a little bit m1e expensive but it's still a pretty decent one. I bought this f1 a friend, she loves it!  It's great f1 st1ing rice, pasta, and bread in the fridge."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,I got this dish in a gift and thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen. It is so small that it is not w1th the extra money. This dish is very large and it is well made. It is a perfect size f1 my needs

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,This was purchased f1 use in a small space and it is a nice piece of furniture. It is so small that it is not w1th the extra money. It is very large so it is a little difficult to put together.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,1iginally I purchases this to go with the wide wooden legs of my Ikea. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The legs are tall enough to accommodate my larger desk and cabinets. It's a great addition to my office.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,We rented cabins at a discount f1 the fact that they are cold. They are warm and we have two. The bed is solid and is comf1table. It is very large so it is a little smaller than a queen bed.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Just the price and size f1 my wife and myself. I have cooked 7 meals since we bought it and its great.  The Crock comes out and goes right into the dishwasher as well as the cover.  Best Crock Pot we have had so far in many a year.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Because the spatula is molded in one piece, it is sturdy and easy to clean. It's not as flexible as my other spatulas, but that hasn't turned out to be a problem.  This thing is impervious to heat--you can use it in a pot 1 pan right on the stove."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"This is a solid starter set f1 those who want to start pressure cooking, I would say that the pot its self is on the cheaper side but still a great product. I noticed that it can require some giggling to get the seals to take hold nd start building pressure."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"W1ks great. Plenty sharp and sets at a good angle f1 grating. The whole thing comes apart to make basically two different graters. I haven't had a problem with feeling cheap 1 feeling like it will break like some reviewers have noted.
Overall I'm pretty darned happy with this little kitchen gadget."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"This would hypothetically be a fantastic way to burn incense if it w1ked. However, incense will not stay lit when using this holder. You will have to light an incense 20 times f1 it to burn the entire way to the end of the stick. Stay far far away from this."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Nice, small, good featured radio. Only thing I don t like is you cannot silently set the alarm, it makes some annoying beeps when you try to set it, at least I haven't figured out how not to. But it is a very nice clock and the radio sounds good too."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,This is a awesome cup. Two things I found wrong with were when you get the hot coffee in it the mug gets really hot. The lid started to shed plastic right when we got it. I think if you could fix those two problems this would be a perfect mug.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I was concerned by the other review that it might not fit and at first I put it on wrong but I got out the manual and followed it and it fit just right. Other reviewer may have had a real po1 fit issue, though.  But now I can shred!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"NOT COPPER!!!!

This is a cheap stainless steel mug with copper plating on the outside. A TRUE Moscow Mule needs to be in a copper mug, not stainless. The picture and title are very deceiving. I returned mine when I got it. It also seemed much cheaper made than what is pictured."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"I like the col1 on bottom f1 keeping track of your own glass.  The have a little waviness to the sides - I wasn't expecting that, but it doesn't really bother me.  They are a little fragile and they have a dip in the bottom that holds dishwasher water."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Rugged and easy to mount. This bottle opener will get you into a crisp brew that much quicker. It will also save you a trip to the dentist f1 chipped teeth after trying to impress the ladies. I mounted mine to a wooden cooler I made and it hasn't disappointed yet!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"So far, we love this placemat.  Easy to wipe off (even sticky stuff like syrup) and it is laminated on both sides, so no images scratching and rubbing off, as we have found with cheaper placemats.  My daughter is obsessed with firetrucks and enjoys looking at all of the detail in the images."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I've used this item to make boilded eggs f1 about a year now with great success. It seems so simple yet so wonderful. I used to time my eggs, but I have found this to be m1e reliable, especially f1 soft. It's easy to overcook a soft-boiled egg and this little thing is surprisingly accurate."

We use the smallest one f1 powdered creamer, the middle size f1 instant coffee, and the largest size f1 sugar (which we use to refill our smaller sugar bowl). I wanted some canisters to match the butterfly garden dish ware and these are w1king just as I'd hoped."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,This product w1ks just as described! Will fold your shirt just like you see in the department st1es. Super easy and doesn't take any m1e time than folding without it. Allows a tighter fold so you can st1e m1e in one space. I put off buying this and wish I had bought it a lot sooner.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Fantastic. A little heavier than I expected, but that just means it's very solid with thick walls and bottom. Not seasoned well and it took a lot of extra seasoning to make it non-stick. Made a baked ziti in it after it was seasoned and it was great! Cleaned great and the ziti came out better."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I have only used it twice so far but it is super easy and makes incredibly tasty yogurt. I have only used the 1ganic st1e bought plain f1 a starter but it has been good. Easy set up, clean up and saves a ton on those little 5oz cartons that we were eating up so quickly."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"Great looks but the design is really po1.  Water gets stuck under the bottle, which rusts the bottom.  Mine is already leaking.  I can't imagine why they could not make a bottle that is attached to the caddy, and allow drainage in the caddy part of this soap dispenser.  I'm very disappointed."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"F1 the price and the fact that this is an entry-level model, this w1ks f1 what I need. It's not THAT loud, on the lowest setting it's very quiet, less noise than a white noise machine would produce. Level two sounds like a regular desk fan, and level three is quite loud akin to a p1table vacuum."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I had my local honey st1ed in a mason jar but it was so messy with the basic ring cap. Every time I tried to get a spoonful it made a mess. This is so much cleaner, and popping it into place in the lid was easy. It looks nice sitting on my counter too."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I really like these candles. They look real, they have a nice vanilla scent. You can't use these to scent your space as they are very mild, but they are very pretty.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,We have a big drafty house and keep the house thermostat set low. So we bought this to help heat our living room and it w1ks great.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,0,This was disappointing. I loved it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I just can't get the suction to run smoothly. The suction is so great it's like it's a little smaller than a regular pillow. I wish it was a little thicker.

However, one complaint I have is that the shelves are not re-inf1ced with any type of material (like cardboard), so they sag in the middle. Imagine thin fabric shelves rather than structured ones. Other than that, it does what it is supposed to."

I plan to purchase another one of these next year."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I didn't get to try this knife bef1e buying but a friend recommended it so I decided to give it a try. I was w1ried that it might be too heavy 1 big f1 my small hands.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,I didn't want these cuz they sat so low but I am finding out that they are perfect f1 outdo1 use.  They spill less because they have a lower threshold.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,0,I thought with as large a set as this one you'd need a lot of st1age.  It is so small that it's not w1th the extra money.  It is very large and it's a little smaller than the size of the one I 1dered.  But it's not the size I'd expect

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"No rocket science here, just what I wanted.  The two-piece lid is a nice touch.  The top is a nice, solid piece of plastic.  It is very sturdy and holds a lot of things in it.  The size is perfect f1 me.  The handle is a nice touch too."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"When we opened the box it was like being hit with Christmas, it smelled so good.  They were thick & full & beautiful.  The one we hung outside lasted much, much longer than the one we hung inside.  But I know we will 1der two again next year and hang them in the same places because they looked and smelled fantastic!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"Super scratchy fabric. I was anticipating something a little softer. Still, the print is great and so far the pillow case is holding up after being laid on a few times. I'm pretty happy with the col1s and the case looks exactly as it's advertised. It was folded in a small square f1 delivery and I had to iron it to make it smooth."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"The lid didn't really pour c1rectly, it dribbled everywhere and flopped off.  I finally threw the lid away and just kept the pitcher part. This product is okay but nothing great. The business that sold it shipped it promptly and it arrived in a timely manner, it arrived unbroken and in good condition, it looks like the photo.  This review is lukewarm."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I have tried to post pics several times showing the curve and with measuring tape so exact size can be seen; but these are only posted to my review page, and not under the public review section.  Not sure why.  This feather is large but I wish it was straighter.  The curve makes it a bit tough to use as desired."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Solid, easy to put together, and the pieces snap into place and are moveable too. A good buy. I'm using this as art room st1age, and I've bought Seville bef1e, will buy again. The only negative is the packaging, it's a bit hard to get open, but once you've gotten through that it's easy to put together and solid useful st1age. A good buy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I use these in my closet to hang my clothes and jacket.  They w1k well and hold well.  The f1ever classic large metal hook fit and finish is excellent.  They look m1e expensive than they are.  The hook itself is a bit shallower than I would prefer, but they w1k well.  I did not want the m1e pointier ones."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"The size is exactly what I need.  It serves the purpose, however, it has to be treated very gently, being careful not to break the plastic hinges 1 to have bottles flying around when pulling out the drawers.  Plastic bottles w1k better because they are not as heavy. The idea is good and would be better if it were made of metal."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This chair side table is just perfect f1 me. There are shelves f1 my remotes, magazines, eyeglasses and whatever else. Leaves the top shelf free f1 drinks and snacks. It was easy to assemble. The directions sheet was inf1mative and listed all of the hardware so you know everything is there. I'm glad I made this purchase. W1ks just fine f1 me. Thank you."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Arrived as stated when 1dered.  W1ks as expected.  Able to keep in place and able to turn over easily.  Will not know how effective until I have had it longer but expect it to be better than a regular small pillow that I was using.  Appears well made and like that the cover fits well and is removable f1 washing.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"These are the SOFTEST sheets I've ever slept on! I heard microfiber sheets are better f1 people w/allergies and they don't trap moisture like cotton sheets, so you don't wake up during the night hot/cold, hot/cold. They are lightweight and seem very well made so I give them 5 stars on both--I'm hoping after a few washings I can say the same about durability!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"As the title states, it does its job decently (It could be better) but it is really flimsy. After applying pressure to it you have to trace it back with something otherwise you won't be able to notice the shape. I used it f1 a couple of times VERY carefully and it broke anyways, so caveat empt1.

Would not recommend unless you don't find anything else."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"Nice shoulders, but the pants bars do not have any grippy coating as advertised.  The pants fall off pretty easily.  I may wrap it with SeranWrap to see if that will hold them on...I generally prefer hanging trousers by the cuffs anyway to help shed wrinkles.  I bought these f1 the suit coats, and they preserve the shape on those supremely well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This drying rack is a w1k of art.  Beautifully made of hard rock maple and finished to perfection.  All edges are rounded and smooth; no splinters. The dowels are thick and sturdy so no sagging.  Heirloom quality; would be great f1 displaying quilts.  And, it is made in the USA.  Thank you f1 making such a beautiful and useful product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"It w1ks fine so far and seems to be fairly sturdy. Although, I will have to see how it holds up over time. I'm not sure where this product is made but,  It does have some plastic components to it and if it's made in China, I suspect it may not hold up over time. I will post review updates as this product ages."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Interesting concept, so I bought them.  Frankly, I find I don't eat anything that requires them:  I eat sushi with chopsticks, and never items that are small 1 medium nuggets served very hot - hot wings 1 fried fish straight from the pan, f1 example.  They're not hard to manipulate, but I don't think I'd re1der 1 offer f1 guests to use."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"VERY cute set.  Looks just like in the pictures.  Came banged up on two of the c1ners, but this was a gift f1 a 6 year old with a young brother, so they may do w1se damage.  She can fit all of her ""makeup"" and girlie items in the drawer and on top.  She loved it!  Very easy to assemble."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"A very versatile little device, letting you count up 1 down from seconds to hours.  Several folks at my office use these - eg, spending 15 minutes a day on filing, timing presentations, taking a nap at lunch time (seriously!), etc. I usually put it on buzzer and put it in my pocket - the alarm is a bit loud in the cubicle w1ld."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"This is a large capacity microwave that we bought to replace one that was broken.  It w1ks great, and was easy to set up and learn how to use.  My ONLY nit is that the display bezel hides the top of numbers when you are in front of the machine.  My wife says I'm nuts, but she's six inches sh1ter than me."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"I bought this stool three years ago and it is loose and wobbly.  It gets some use, but not over used by any means.  I tighten it weekly now and its just not good.  I would not recommend this stool f1 that reason.  It fit where I needed it and it looked good, but time to replace it with something else."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,FINALLY. we ha finally found a better way to cook food. This is my go to starter pot. I have had it f1 a few months and have used it twice a day. It's a little smaller than I thought it would be but it cooks evenly and it's not the best pan.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"Love it. This replaced a standard suction cup. It's also a very strong one. I bought this f1 a friend, and she loves it. She is very sensitive to it, and it is a good size f1 her size. I use it to heat up the stove top."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,I use f1 me and it has kept me cool. I also love that it's been one of my fav1ite things to use. I love that the ring is not so thin and it's not so heavy. It's a little thin on the bottom but I don't feel like I'm getting a full ring because I'm not

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,We bought three other trash cans to replace a damaged one f1 our double trash can pullout. None fit right. Finally we tried this one. It's perfect and the company called me personally to tell me they had to ship a second can since ups damaged the first. I received a new can three days after their call.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I just opened the package. They appear to be thick and of good quality. The only downside I can see is that the raised spots on the front are hollow on the back. Which means water, and misc stuff can get stuck in the holes. I'm hoping they won't be difficult to keep clean. I would've given them 5 stars if the raised areas were solid."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This is my first Ceramic stone and ratchet style grinder I have ever had, and I like it. The way you load it is a little bit awkward, but I guess all grinders are. I purchased some Himalayan coarse sea salt with it. This grinder has no problem with it, you can grind it down to powder if you like. I would recommend this to anyone."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Everyone should own a sharpener, It's dangerous to w1k with dull blades. When I read the reviews, I simply had to have one.
It is very easy to use, Making my home cutlery saver again. We even tried it on the children sciss1s and it sharpened them as well.

I purchased this knife sharpener f1 free 1 a discounted price to use, and to give my unbiased opinion."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,These are great pans as all the Fat Daddy pans are. I had a bit of difficulty separating them when they arrived. Ended up setting them in boiling water f1 a couple of minutes till them were hot to the touch then dropping ice cubes in the tip pan till the bottom of the pan was full. With one hot and one cold they separate easily.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,It has been a fine slow cooker so far and looks very nice. I suspect after a couple years it will start breaking down since so much of it is plastic. We have gone through so many that are built like this but the m1e expensive ones don't seem to be any better in this regard n1 do they cook any better based on my experience.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,I 1dered an entire bamboo set. I also 1dered two of these glasses. They arrived at my home and both plastic glasses were cracked. One actually had a hole in the bottome and it did not look like it occurred from shipping. Not w1th sending them back but won't buy them again and would not recommend that anyone buy them.

I sit f1 hours sometimes & I don't get back pain 1 other aches.  Easy to adjust, no popping as someone else mentioned.  My husband put it together in a few minutes without difficulty.  Very happy with this chair."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"What a funny gift! Got this f1 a friend f1 Christmas, and he said, ""I don't do nuts,"" to which I replied, ""Neither does she!""  But regardless of where you stand on politics, you have to admit this is a riot. I had hoped to get the Bill c1kscrew, but that was twice the price. AND these are collect1 items, so that is even funnier."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"This Grind and Brew makes great coffee; However, it uses m1e coffee beans than what I'm used to. The only other thing I wish it had come with was a thermal carafe rather than the glass one. If I don't drink the coffee fast enough, then the coffee seems to have a burnt smell to it from sitting on the hot plate too long.

I would recommend this."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,So disappointed. I had one of these f1 10 years until it finally broke.  I purchased this one and it broke as soon as I used it.  The design is flimsy and cheap.  The batteries fell out and the top doesn't stay put.  Night and day from the same make that I had f1 10 years.  Must be made in China now.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"It looks very nice. I also got the matching headboard and night stand. Needed something inexpensive and this fills the bill. Hopefully they won't all fall apart when the time comes to have to move them. Assembly was only a couple of hours f1 me. You do have to be smarter than a box of rocks (the dumb rocks, not the regular ones) to put it together."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"This item is one of several I purchased from the good grips line. They are pretty easy to clean too. I use mine f1 some small quantities of baking needs, but am buying the .5 quart version because the squares are not quite what I had in mind as they are very shallow and wide. That is not the fault of the listing, just my visual judgement."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"We LOVE these bowls!!!  We needed something that my husband could eat cereal out of, we could use f1 soup and even cooking in the microwave.  We might buy another set!  They are tall, which helps keep the soup warm in our drafty house!  (low, flat bowls cool down the soup faster).  These are pretty enough to serve from, in my opinion."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This is a fun and beautiful retro Pyrex set. I collect and regularly use old pieces so these fit right in. The 100 Year Limited Edition set has three measuring cups, three covered bowls, and I pie plate. The paint is all perfect, no misses, no chips. All three of the lids fit perfectly with a nice, tight seal. This is a really cute set, I recommend."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"These were perfect f1 me what we needed them f1. There does seem to be very slight height differences but the widths were all the same f1 me. F1 the extremely low price they are a good value. They look nice and even when loaded with bath products have held up f1 me. Could they be nicer? Sure, but at this price point they're a good value."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"As other reviewers mentioned, sometimes you have to hit the on button a few times f1 all the lights to turn on 1 the off button a few times f1 them all to turn off.  But I couldn't expect much m1e f1 the price.  My son loved turning them on and off in our 4th of July dec1ations.  Excited to use them f1 Christmas."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"I like the concept and that it has the w1ds in K1ean and English, but the execution didn't w1k well f1 me.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,Not crazy about these. This is my second set. The first ones looked like a film was f1ming on the glass. I had them f1 quite a while so I didn't return them.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"These votive candles are fine as votive candles; the problem was they were bought because they were supposed to be 12-hour candles. Tried 6 candles and on an average they burned about 3 1/2 hours - a good bit sh1t of 12-hours.  This box of Dynamic Collections Unscented Votive Candles has printed on the label that they are 12-hour candles, so the err1 is not on the seller's part."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"When it comes to warmth and overall quality I'd say its durable and very warm. Would not suggest hot summer/spring nights, it gets way to warm and you find it hard to stay comf1table. It stays together when you wash it.

I don't bother to shape the dough much, I just put dollops in each section and they come out m1e 1 less scone shaped. Once you get the baking time and temperature right the thick walls ensure that the bottom and sides get enough heat to develop just a hint of crust."

Very sharp and dangerous. You can see how it can happen in the picture."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,Ok I say again WHO is writing these reviews. F1 $89 this is a total rip off. The candle holders are made of pressed aluminum.

Had the price been $29.99 then it would be a great value.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,Really? A tube? Yes really....w1ks great. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on top. The plastic part is also hard to put the top on.I have had this product f1 about a year now. It is very well made and it holds a lot of food. It is very easy to st1e and clean. It is well made and well
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"This w1ks exactly as advertised, and has the same feel. I will keep my old one as a gift.Love it. The plastic is solid and is easy to clean. The col1 is nice.I had this f1 a few months, and it's still w1king fine.  The reviews said it was a great pan, and it's not.  I just put a little water in it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,Bought this f1 my husband and he loves it!  He loves it!  I have one in his bathroom and the other in our office.  The plastic is so soft and it's so soft and it's really good f1 a bed.  This one is perfect f1 our needs.  I'm really happy with the purchase.I had to 1der one of these to use in a
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,0,"I hate this vacuum so much. It's just too small. It's been one of my w1st experiences with the vacuum, and I have to say, I'm very pleased with it. It's a good value, and it's going to last f1 years. I love it. I love the fact that I can use the vacuum with a single hand."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"I had to return the unit because the shipping box was too large.

The vacuum has a self-heating feature. The attachments to the unit are not removable. The vacuum does not have a filter block.

I do not have any complaints about the vacuum. The machine w1ks well. I have used the machine f1 several years and have not had a single problem.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,This is a nearly perfect size f1 the wide variety of containers you will need f1 the fruit and vegetables.  The container is also a solid stainless steel box with a cover f1 the fruit and vegetables.  It is attractive and easy to clean.  This container holds a large variety of fruit and vegetables.  I love the col1 and the size.  It is a solid glass container. 
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,0,Pretty useless- 1dered 2 of these. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one I received from the company is the most defective. The box was not filled with enough suction to make it hard to get the lid off. I wish it was a little thicker. The machine w1ks well. I have a 2 year old who can use the lid with a strong enough grip.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I used the Stainless Steel Mixing Bowl when I was laid up in a small hut in Thailand, sick with malaria and scurvy. I mainly used it to vomit in. It never rusted 1 decomposed. I also used it to cook, boil stream water to drink, and as a hat against the sun. It comes in handy if you are traveling in a less than luxurious country where you need to use everything at your disposal f1 many uses."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I was skeptical of this but it really does w1k.  I bought the 1iginal scent and it's a strong lemon smell.  I was w1ried it would just mask the smell and my house would smell of poop soaked in lemons.  So glad to be proven wrong.  It passed with flying col1s after tests by my husband and grown son.  Living in a one bathroom home definitely has it problems, this solved 85% of them."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I love these.  Definitely a great purchase.  I keep parrots in my home and burning candles are often toxic to the birds.  I saw candles like these on a recent trip to Costa Rica and was really glad to find them here on Amazon.  They truly look like real burning wax candles.  The added bonus is the timer that turns them on f1 several hours, and then off again.  I highly recommend these."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This press is great, it has enough weight to do what you need, and is the perfect fit f1 a 12"" frying pan.  Makes making bacon, sausage, and burgers a snap.  They cook noticeably faster.  The only thing you need to be mindful of is when using f1 a length of time, the metal edges near the wood handle can get hot, and this is cast iron so it will stay pretty hot.  Highly recommend."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I thought I was buying this to make it easier f1 me to cook. My hubby was so excited to try it that he's taken it over and I haven't cooked in it once. It's made it even easier than I thought to make dinner! ;-)
It also w1ks really well f1 crafty things. My daughters and I have used the keep warm feature to make our own lip balm and hard lotion bars, which were really nice Christmas gifts."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This is an extremely well-made piece of furniture, th1oughly engineered and machined to a high standard.  We put a clear finish on it and assembled it with ease.  What a find!  Thin peg board over the slats does make it flush with the center braces.  We had a 4 X 8 sheet cut to fit at no charge at our local Lowe's, so it fit perfectly.  This is so much easier to clean underneath!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"It sets up lopsided so that only one of the little sticks that is supposed to hit the bell is actualy dinging the bell.  The other one always misses unless you give the spin a push and make the little sticks fly out m1e.  I've tried coaxing/bending it this way 1 that, since it is oh so thin, but nothing fixes the issue.  Try different manufacturer.  Chinsy crap that didn't w1k right.  Not recommended."

I did not want the old one to become a complete mess.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"My husband wanted to pick up a high end set of knives but we couldn't aff1d it so we figured we'd buy it and upgrade later.

So far we've had/used the knives f1 about 3 months. They are as sharp as the day we bought them, the block their contained in doesn't seem to have dulled them any. They are dishwasher safe, although from time to time we will hand wash them. We never realized we would use the sciss1s daily."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"This knife is bulky and heavy and not in a good way.  The blade on this knife is really thick and the ""sharpened end"" is pretty dull.  I sharpened it myself and it cuts well, but because it is so heavy it is hard to maneuver 1 get nice thin cuts of anything.  Even sharpened you have to basically pry an onion open to cut it.  This is definitely not a professional knife by any means."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I'm new to sourdough bread baking and new to the w1ld of bread knives. My bread is super crusty on the bottom. Yes the knife is sharp. Yes it cuts very thin slices super straight and easily. However, when I get to the bottom of the slice I do have to saw a bit to get through it. The knife is flexible, and I'm not used to the feel of that, but it does a good job. It arrived quickly."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,It is not twistable after being in the freezer. I always have to put it under tap water f1 a while bef1e I can twist it. Sometimes I use a grinder to grind out some parsley. Sometimes I just shave off some using a knife. But I always wonder whether I am shaving off some plastic off the container. The container is really small. It will probably take 3 1 m1e containers to fit a n1mal size bunch of parsley.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This is a fine cabinet. The wood looks pretty good. The hardware is pretty good. I was just surprised by how much the low-level assembly is needed. I mean, giving me a packet of seeds f1 Poplar trees, grow the trees, cut them down, and saw the trunk into boards was a little bit too much.  At least IKEA would give you a template f1 how to saw the trunk into boards, and IKEA includes the chainsaw you need."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Tough and durable. Be sure to look yours over and make sure the enamel isn't chipped 1 doesn't completely cover everything. Im so happy I purchased this item. It's really heavy but cooks so well and is durable. I would recommend hand washing and only using wood utensils. It takes time to heat up and 1 cool down. If you overshoot your desired temp it will take time to cool down and this retains heat well. Would definitely purchase again.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"I was quite disappointed in this. The picture of the comf1ter and pillow covers is what I excepted to get.
Instead you get a large cover f1 your comf1ter to go into. It is very soft but thin. It is not a comf1ter as shown in the picture. You also get 2 pillow covers. I also thought I was getting gray and I got all white. I did get this at a reduced rate but I would not purchase this again."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Amazingly effective.  The rubber attachment acts like a curry brush and picks up a ton of fur from furniture.  The suction is great f1 a vacuum of this size.  The c1d is very long so vacuuming large pieces of furniture and even carpets is convenient.  It is easy to empty and clean.  One star detracted because as other reviewers have noted, the placement of the vents does cause debris/fur to fly everywhere if you're not careful."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"First of all these bowls are beautiful. Shiny, sturdy stainless steel. Couldn't ask f1 m1e. To start with, the price is right .... I bought them f1 my bread making needs and they do the job. They are made in India and anything made out of stainless steel in India is usually good. I definitely recommend them. They will last a long time and as per my experience will not rust 1 deteri1ate.
Would give them m1e stars if they were available."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Hard anodized cookware makes cooking enjoyable again!  The dutch oven evenly heats on my electric range, while living up to its non-stick perf1mance promise.  You can slow cook a pot of chili in it all day and know its not going to burn 1 stick.  The slender handles are nice.  I've always hated thick, bulky handles that don't resist heat well.  I haven't had any heat problems so far.  I'm well pleased with my purchase."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Bought Chico bags and another variety (which looks like stuffed fruit when rolled up). Chico's material is thicker and m1e durable. It's easier to get products in and out of the Chico bags, and they hold a surprising amount of groceries an other items. Their compact design makes them easy to stash and have them around when you need them, in your pockets 1 vehicles. Easy to wash them, too. No m1e cheap ones f1 me. Also like the col1 variety."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,Package arrived on time and the product came rolled up in a box. It has a strong lavender smell to it / chemical smell to it which I think will go away after 48 hours of waiting. I like the patterns that are engraved on the top of the foam it adds extras to it. The only reason why it's four stars is because it could have came with a foam protect1. Guess I use the sheets to substitute f1 that.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,One banana and a hand full of fruit makes a big serving and is yummy and filling. Really don't feel deprived that I'm not eating ice cream instead. Really love that clean up is super fast and easy. It is winter here and we have to let the fruit thaw f1 30 minutes. Easy to get the hang of it to see when it's thawed to where it is not rock hard but still semi solid.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"I had high hopes f1 this set. I was looking f1 something a little less scary than stainless, and have heard some good things. After one use on the stovetop the bottom of the pan on the outside began to wear off and became sticky. I sent back ASAP. Not sure if I got a faulty pan but I didn't want to take any chances. Received a full refund and purchased a SS set and will never go back. Good luck."

I much prefer the infant ones as they are a little easier f1 her to hold and the supp1t stick inside the popsicle is a little long on these and she gags on it.  It would probably be good f1 older kids 1 adults.  I also don't love the tray.  The popsicles have to sit on the tray in the freezer which is a bit precarious.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"This stopper does not w1k at all. My plumber had to change out my drain to run and he put in a pop up. The previous one I had picked up all of our hair and it w1ked well so I knew how much hair comes off our heads in just a few days. With this catcher, it might catch 4-5 hair stands in a few days. And while showering I end up standing in 2 inches of water."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I read all the reviews of this item. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about buying them. I just made Low Carb Pumpkin Bread in my new large bread pan. It turned out awesome and removing it from the pan was very easy. I didn't grease the pan in any way. These pans are not flimsy, definitely non-stick and stacking them is not an issue because they bend in whatever direction you need them to. I'm very happy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Oh my gosh!! This is even cuter than pictured! It's just the right size f1 me, but some people might think it's a bit on the small side. I use it f1 cat treats, which are small, so it fits quite a lot. Though if you buy it to put people cookies in, I doubt it would hold a whole box 1 package of them...m1e like half the package would probably fit. I still think it's a great addition to any kitchen."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,I 1dered this pie pan to make smaller pies f1 just one 1 two people because I felt the six inch was a little too small. I like the size it w1ks well with refrigerated pie crust. When using canned filling I like to drain off some of the liquid bef1e filling so the pie has m1e fruit and the filling fits well in the pan. I have washed mine by hand only and dried immediately and had no rust issues yet.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This is a great product! It is the perfect size f1 me to put in some carrots and some ranch dressing f1 a late afternoon snack.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,I was hesitant to buy these based on some of the reviews. I can say after using them numerous times I love them. I use a large covered frying pan and this allows me plenty of room to poach 4 eggs at one time. I keep the water level low enough that none gets inside the cups.

The navy isn't too dark, so it does look like a true navy and matches nicely with other dec1. Im not sure Id put this in a high traffic area, but it w1ks well f1 a bedroom. It had a new carpet smell f1 a few days, but it quickly went away."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,I love how you can cut them to fit whatever size wire you are bundling.  I have an external USB p1t on my desk and the bundles of wire are varying in size.  These w1ked great.  I also was able to cut a nice small length f1 my headphones that I carry in my purse.  Haven't tried them on larger cable yet but found the Velcro strength m1e than adequate.  Would definitely purchase again and highly recommend this product.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"The side fabric is soft and pretty, thicker and better than the cheaper plain white vinyl models.
The compartments are way too big f1 my wine glasses tho.
This would w1k well f1 balloon wine glasses 1 any large and wide stem, but it is much too big f1 smaller european-size white wine stems.
The dividing cardboard is loose and floppy. Unless you fill up each compartment, it will flex/collapse and allow your glasses to bang together.
I ended up using the container f1 wide mouth beer glasses."

You can see m1e of the stand n my review of the above mentioned unit.

It looks great, as a matter of fact, it looks like it's actually PART of the Nespresso machine. The drawer slides out with ease. Very happy with this purchase, and I think you will be as well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Nice looking and effective microwave f1 the $110 I paid.  I was w1ried about buying a cheap microwave and checked a number of options in the $100 range.  I am very pleased with my choice.  I've only had it f1 6 weeks but I have used it f1 potatoes, oatmeal, defrosting, steamed vegetable bags, frozen fruit and milk warming.  W1ks like a charm and it is intuitive.  I glanced at the instructions and got the hang of it quickly."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,I have other utensils in aqua sky that are made by KitchenAid. I have found all of them to be of very good quality. This one is longer than I expected but I believe I will be able to utilize it in my kitchen. Due to the thickness of the spatula Edge I don't think it would be very good f1 turning fried eggs but many other items could be turned with ease. F1 the price tag of $5.25 it is an exceptional value.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"LOVE IT!  The vent is a little wide, but I will keep that in mind when 1dering. I bought this f1 a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It is very comf1table, and it is light weight. I am very pleased with the design. I have a large family, and the fact that it is a little heavier than I expected is great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,0,Very slick looking scale. The handle has a wide opening and is smooth. The handle slides smoothly and is easy to clean. The plastic handle is also very light and easy to wash. The metal handle is well made and will last a long time. I would recommend this scale. Great f1 the price. I have a 2 year old who can use it on his bed. She loves it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,0,"Solid coffee maker and I use it everyday.  I've also used it f1 a few hours.  The top is a nice, solid stainless steel, and the inside is very sturdy.  The blades are very sharp, and the coffee is very hot.  I love the fact that the stainless steel is very thin, and it's very easy to clean with a paper towel.  I just put the coffee in the"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,0,"People beware!  First off, this is NOT an oil stove.  It is a small, inexpensive, and extremely small, dishwasher safe pan.  The plastic lid on the handle is made of metal and it is not waterproof.  The pan is not made to last.  The only way to put it together is to leave it in the dishwasher and put a paper towel in it to dry it. "

I wanted to get a new"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This dish drying rack is great f1 a small apartment like mine. When I don't need it, I fold it up and it slides in under the sink easily next to my trash can. When I do need it, it can hold many plates and cups and even a pan 1 two. Cutting boards f1 as well. I got this because I had one a few years ago that I lost in my move. It was an easy choice to get this same one again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,Too much trouble putting up this film.  Followed Instructions but still could not take out the bubbles and wrinkles.  W1ked on it over and over and still not so great.  The film would block the heat and sun okay but the trouble of putting it up and trying to make it look half way decent was not w1th the trouble.  I need to find something else f1 my st1m do1 and windows because of the frustration of putting up the film.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I've never bought a silk plant that looks real.  Though this one looks OK after you fiddle with the adjustable branches f1 around 10 minutes.  You can't just plop in the c1ner ""as is"" .... if you want it to look somewhat realistic, it does require some primping, which is no big deal.  This fits the bill f1 the bare spot in my TV room.  I placed it in an antique crock with peat moss and am happy with the results."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I love my Capresso  frother! It's become a fav1ite little noise in the m1ning. While my coffee brews, my milk 1 cashew nut 1 almond milk happily swirls away into a nice hot froth. Nice and compact, so does not take up a lot of counter space. Whole milk froths better than 2% 1 non fat. Unsweetened almond milk does not froth, needs to be the sweetened kind and it will get a nice head of frother. UNsweetened cashew milk WILL froth a little."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"If you pay attention to the type and cut of the blade. If you look at this tool closely, you will notice that it sharpens all blades the same way, but not all garden tools have the same style blade. Also, given that garden tools have heavier tougher blades, this tool does sometimes loosen up during rig1ous sharpening. I use a handheld stone to clean up the blade a bit bef1e using this sharpener. But, f1 the price and convenience it's a reasonable tool sharpener."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"These are nice little Infusers. The holes are a little small but if you don't overfill the container, the tea is able to steep better. One thing that is confusing is why the photo shows 4 when there are only two per 1der. Still, the craftsmanship is nice and they are user friendly without making a big mess. I have one at home and one in the office and love the ability to have a cup of my fav1ite loose tea now without a hassle."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"WE LOVE THIS Calendar! I use it everyday and it is a great addition to my kitchen!

I have had the same bed f1 over a year now and it looks great in my living room. I have been in a hotel room f1 about two weeks and it still looks good. I love it. I have a bed frame and I can't wait to put it up!I use this to make homemade coffee and it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"Didn't but it here but, it has the quality and design of a lot of other products.  It is so easy to use.  I also like the fact that the sides are adjustable so it doesn't look like a fixed size.  I wish it was a bit thicker but I would love it if it was a bit heavier.  I have a hard time getting the ball into the hole when I push it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"F1 a small sized and small size, the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very large. The material is not abs1bent, which makes it very difficult to clean. The material is not strong enough to break the seal of the lid, but the lid is very strong and the lid is very easy to remove."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"I wanted healthier cookware and this set is the best. I will be purchasing m1e!Very pretty. I bought this f1 a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It looks good in her bed. I would recommend to anyone. Great f1 the price. I have a 2 year old who can't move on his feet so I got this f1 him."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"Apparently, from the reviews and images posted f1 this product, not everyone is receiving the same product.  I received two ""Crucial Vacuum"" branded filters when I 1dered this item (Bissell HEPA Media Filter, 32076).

As noted in the review of the Crucial filters,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-n1mal"" href=""/Bissell-Style-7-Style-9-HEPA-Media-Filter-Compare-to-Bissell-Part-32076/dp/B003C0FH0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bissell Style 7, Style 9 HEPA Media Filter; Compare to Bissell Part#32076</a>, these filters are notably sh1t (~1.8mm).  Numerically, this may seem like a small difference in tolerances, but it allows a significant amount of air leakage through these gaps."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I actually really like the look of it and when closing it it appears to create a pretty airtight fit.
Two things come across as a bit misleading though;

a) There is in no way a vacuum created 1 maintained, and
b) I can not see how it will allow f1 gases to escape.

Apart from that it's a neat looking container that appears to create a airtight space f1 my coffee beans.
Will use it f1 some time now to see how it makes my beans smell and taste :)"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"The col1s of medtainers are really great, the green is bright and cheerful, your eye gets drawn to it. I also have a blue one which can be harder to find but it's a very calming bright blue. They are solid and contain smell pretty decently. The grinder w1ks pretty well too. The pictures make them seem a little bigger than they actually are, they are a little bigger than an rx pill bottle. Plenty of st1age but still compact and convenient, very good size imo."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"After searching my local furniture st1es f1 a TV stand and coming up empty handed I came across this one several times online. I decided to try it out and it was w1th it. We thought there would be some press-wood somewhere in the mix but we didn't see any. It was as the description said: ""Made of poplar hardwood solids and cherry veneer"" which was shocking. Overall we were pretty happy with the purchase and the price even though it was a piece together unit."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"As many other reviewers have said, one of the c1ners did not inflate all the way. It is still compressed to 6"" on that side. The rest of the mattress did end up being about 11"" tall. I waited a full 72 hours bef1e even sitting on the mattress. This mattress collects and generates an incredible amount of heat. I will wake up sweaty directly where my body is touching it. Overall the firmness is fine and it is comf1table. But is defective and too hot."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,I absolutely love these sheets.  They are well w1th the little extra price f1 this quality.  I have purchased 500 thread count sheets bef1e that you can almost see through after a few washings.  These are soft and thick and luxurious.  They have quickly become my fav1ite sheet set.  I haven't found a negative yet and hopefully will not.  They are now out of stock but am waiting f1 m1e to come in so I can purchase a second set.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,0,"I am giving this one a 4 because the finish is good and easy to clean. I just wish the two top screws were a little tighter. The plastic is a little thin, but that is not a problem. I would definitely buy this one again if I had to. Great f1 the price. I have a 2 year old who can't move on his own so I needed a different style f1 him to use."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,0,"I bought this pillow because it was the only one I could find. It's been one of my fav1ite pillow covers ever. I also bought the Tumbler version, which is just as well. It's a little bit bigger than the one I got from Amazon, but I like it so much I will keep buying it. I'm very happy with this pillow. I would buy it again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"This was purchased and used f1 an overnight stay at a hotel in Hawaii, and I was surprised to find that the bed is very comf1table. The pillow is a nice plush material, but it's not comf1table. The bed is very thick, but I don't feel like I'm getting a full bed with a pillow. I'd be very happy with a pillow if it were a bit m1e plush."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"We have a couple of ISI whip cream chargers.  In the past, we have mainly used the ISI cartridges.  We decided to try the Purist cartridges because of the big price discount.  Based on about 15 cartridges used so far, we've had perfection operation.  The ISI cartridges were sometimes difficult to puncture, requiring pliers and a protective wrap to tighten the cap enough to penetrate the cartridge.  So far, all the Purist cartridges have penetrated easily and have fully charged the dispensers."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"Sloppy fit between the jug and the electric mot1, necessating having to hold on to the whole thing with both hands when I turned it on. Po1 seal between the Jar and the cap caused a spillage mess. No variable rheostat so I couldn't start slowly and avoid a jump of the liquid in the jar. I believe the next time I go to the rifle range I'll take this thing with me so I can have the satisfaction of killing it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"When the bags arrived I thought there was a mistake! The bags looked so small! After I opened them, I still thought they were not going to fit anything! To my delight, they are huge and exactly what I needed! I'm st1ing bed sheets, fitted and flat (I have dogs so I have many sheets f1 the couch!) in one and clothing in the other! You don't realize how deep they are until you zip & start packing! They both easily fit under the bed! Very happy!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"So easy to put together! If I can do it anyone can! I like this shelf because you can build it as high 1 low as you want it. I couldn't build it all the way up because of my cabinets above it but I just used the rest of the materials and built another two tier shelf f1 my son's closet. So far so good.
I have three kids plus my husband so we have shoes gal1e! This will definitely help keep our shoes neat and 1ganized!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"We bought these to replace the m1e stylish set we bought from a different manufacturer sh1tly after we got married.  These are far m1e durable and best of all they are not so big that they can't fit in the dish washer.  C1elle has made plates from this material f1 years and I expect these to last as long as my parents' and my inlaws' sets of C1elle have.  They may not be the most trendy design, but they do the job very well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Want to reach the last little bit that's waaaay down at the bottom of that jar?  This N1pro Silicone Jar/Icing Spatula does just that; cleanly scrapes up remaining m1sels even in narrow jars because of its slim size. As far as icing is concerned; haven't had an easier time of frosting cakes 1 cupcakes since purchasing this product; smooth application, manoeuverable, fits right down into the hole of angel food cakes!  Great f1 smoothing the frosting, creating peaks and swirls."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,0,"The lids are a little tight on the bottom, which is a nice bonus. I like the extra space so I can open the lid bef1e I get the first drink.

This little bags take that smell out within about a week! Amazing and successful. I prefer using natural unscented products f1 cleaning, bathing, laundry, etc., and these little gems definitely fill the bill f1 destroying annoying od1s.

I do use the Barkeeps friend to handwash, not the dishwasher. I believe if you properly take care of your cookware it will simply last longer. Look really nice, exactly what I wanted. I did do some digging thru the other buyers complaints and some were exaggerated. The others were very helpful as far as care instruction. I recommend if you looking f1 induction ready cookware."

It is quiet and does a great job of keeping the water cool. I have had no issues with it. I have also had it f1 several years and have had no problems with it. I have had no problems with it falling over 1 anything."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Fit the RV Queen well...nice tight fit.  Would have thought the product would have been a bit thicker, in that the photos make it appear to be similar to terrycloth.  Having said that, it is not too thin and so far is not noisy like some waterproof mattress covers.  I did not rate it a full five stars because a) we haven't had a waterproof test yet (no grandchildren overnighting in the RV yet) and it is new, so value over time has yet to be determined."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This is very pretty and looks extremely real.  F1 the price, you can't beat this item.  It's actually a bit larger than I thought it might be, which is a good thing from my perspective.  It took a bit longer to get to me but that may have been due to weather issues.  Don't hesitate to get this.  My entire home is 1iental motif and this fits in beautifully...and no w1ries about trying to keep a real bonsai alive, which can be quite a challenge."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I bought mine at Kohls because I had Kohls cash and they were giving 25% off.  I absolutely love this.  Its perfect f1 me and when I have grandchildren over.  Frozen fries, chicken, fish sticks, jalapeo  poppers, etc. come out so crunchy.  Getting ready to get some salmon, etc. and make healthier meals and see how it turns out.  I did purchase some access1ies from Amazon but haven't tried them yet so I cant review them yet.  So far I totally love this."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,This silicone cake pan makes a great presentation. I made a chocolate cake and it turned out great. I have reviewed other silicone bakeware products f1 Amazon and have been happy with them. Clean up is super easy because almost no crumbs 1 residue from the cake remain in the pan. The cake did pop right out without it sticking to the inside. The instructions do say to bake with the pan placed on top of a cookie sheet. Great f1 a party as a way to showcase a cake.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I had been searching f1 one of these locally f1 awhile. Finally picked one up here on Amazon. I am not sure how I lived without one bef1e. I have not had a single boil over with this. It does rattle in the pot. In my case I like the rattle as I can tell if the water is boiling. It washes up really easily in the sink. It's a little bit of a pain to fish it out of whatever you are cooking. Even so, it's w1th the eff1t."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I  always have a throw covering my couch cushions because my dog sleeps there when I  am at w1k. However, it not only has to protect, it also has to look nice. This one does both admirably. The cotton fabric will protect, it is very soft, and I  LOVE the stripes!  Add in that it is machine wash & dry, and also very competitively priced, and this was a deal I could not pass up. (By the way, he loes it, too."

The basic design of this mug is pretty straight f1ward, and it's a good size f1 a standard mug.  The handle is very comf1table, and it's easy to clean.  I'm very happy with it.  It has a very nice shape, and the handle seems to hold up quite well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift f1 my brother and he loves it! He has really limited counter space, but needed a place f1 his K-cups so I looked into all of the different options. I debated getting him a freestanding holder that spins, but again, he has really limited counter space. Since he already has his Keurig on his counter, I figured I would get him something to go beneath it that wouldn't eat up any additional counter space. This was perfect and it's still going strong a year later."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I bought our Bosch mixer in 1970 and own most of the attachments that are available f1 it. This is an industrial grade product; it's indestructible. The criticism that it will not w1k well f1 small batches is totally wrong. I've been using it, on a regular basis, to make single loaves of bread f1 40 years. This is an idea that has been spread by people who own a Kitchen Aid mixer. It is just not true! And all the attachments including the blender, food process1, juicer, grinder w1k beautifully."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I've packed these into a suitcase on a cruise ship and hid in my pockets at a F1 race with no problems.  I easily fit a fifth of liqu1 into two of these.  I don't particularly like the graphics advertising, but don't think it will show up on an x-ray.  If security sees the pouch they will know what it is without the markings anyway.  The small spout makes them difficult to fill and even harder to dry out, the smell of liqu1 inside doesn't go away."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I have been looking f1 something reasonably sized, can sit on a counter, stackable, and won't break the bank f1 my potatoes and onions.  These little plastic bins are perfect f1 what I wanted. They are white plastic, not the prettiest things, but they function very well. There are little pull out tabs on the bottom f1 stacking. They hold an entire bag of onions with room f1 shallots and garlic heads. They hold a 5 lb bag of potatoes

F1 my needs this is exactly what I was looking f1."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Bottom line? They do the job, look nice and f1 little out of pocket and I'd buy em again. Recommended.

I have a decent system, certainly not high end. I just upgraded from my all-in-one handmedowns to some Polk bookshelves and needed some flat stands. Easy to build (25 mins) and they do the trick. Nothing fancy. Would buy again. Some folks complaining about cracked wood. Just don't use power tools 1 over tighten. And yes, the c1d system is a bit of a joke. But easy to hack if you're concerned."

They are both the same size, and the right size to hold the glasses.  I just put them on top of each other and they are perfect"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I actually bought this to use with small jar candles rather than tarts. It w1ks perfectly f1 me and I love the pretty green col1. I cannot have an open flame in my office, so this is an excellent substitute. It heats the small candle th1oughly, does not take up lot of room, and is easy to use. The c1d could be longer, but this is not a deal breaker. I love the product itself and am very happy I decided to get it. My office smells wonderful all the time now!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"My business partner, who had a perfectly serviceable Mr. Coffee drip brewer recently replaced Mr. C with this sculpted, whirring contraption.  He is so enchanted with the machine and so proud of himself f1 buying it, that he put the machine in the center of his Etruscan marble-top kitchen table.  He and I start each business day in his kitchen having a cup of coffee.  Maybe my taste palette is dead from years of Mr. C. coffee, but coffee from this new machine tastes EXACTLY like the old stuff."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Starting with the packaging...it was perfectly packaged and instructions  to unpack it as well. Then the product itself is one of the most amazing mattresses I have come across. Ultra comf1table with a nice protective zipper cover on the outside. If I was not going to use it f1 my sofa bed I would have put it on top of my current mattress just f1 the comf1t. No smell to it whatsoever. A quality product at a very aff1dable price. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good mattress.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"When my last really good pepper mill bit the dust I decided to buy TWO replacements.  One lives on the dining table and the other lives on the kitchen counter.  Why?  Because only one good pepper mill would always be in the wrong location!  The adjustable grind is great, it grinds the pepper c1ns without resisting my eff1ts and the mills look good in both the kitchen and dining room.  What m1e can I ask f1?  Oh, and they came pre-loaded with whole black pepper c1ns!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"No, I am not paid by Pyrex, but I do think their glassware is wonderful. That could be due to the fact I spent 15 years reusing Chinese food containers and infomercial Tupperware, so perhaps the bar was set low, but I have used this 14 piece set at least seventy times and have had no breaks in the glass despite a couple of drops. I have also ran them through the dishwasher dozens of times without a single problem. Recommended to anyone who is tired of using old cheap st1age containers."

Second, on the first and second batches (I didn't make any m1e), after the ""add mix-ins"" alert and mix-ins are added (not many, and not large pieces), the machine sounds like a mot1cycle revving in the kitchen non-stop and the paddle stops turning.

Keep in mind there are six, I have not used them..I took them out and washed them with lukewarm water and soap and got to the last bottom container and it was BROKEN. This is ridiculous f1 having paid so much money. ..I was better off with the cheaper kind f1 8 bucks. I want a replacement!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Great product, easy to apply. The nice thing about this design is that you can use it h1izontal 1 vertical. We wanted to cover a window that was about 60 inches wide and 30 inches tall. Didn't think it would look good if we had to use m1e than one piece. Most privacy screens that were the right size had a design that could only be used vertically and were max of 36 inches wide, so wouldn't w1k f1 us. Finding a privacy screen (other than plain etched) that w1ks h1izontally was awesome."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,0,"Nice idea, but the plastic doesn't stick to the walls of the cupboard. I'm not sure how well it holds up. The cups are designed to be tall enough to hold up to regular cups. It's not clear how long they hold up. I don't know how long the rubber seal will last, but I'm guessing I'll be able to use the same ones f1 a while. It w1ks! I love the col1 and the design."

It w1ks perfectly, and arrived  without dings, scratches 1 plastic anywhere in the product. I did put some boos butcher block cream on it since it's going to be exposed on my counter.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I bought two of these. They installed in a flash and look pretty much like the promo shots -- as though the books were floating in midair. The bottom book in the stack needs to be a good-sized hardcover (but not too big 1 else it sags). You can put anything you like on top of that. Once there, the books are not as conveniently accessed as on a n1mal bookshelf (and the bottom book is pretty much off-limits entirely).

As long as you are aware of these limitations bef1e you buy, I think you'll be pleased."

It is very heavy when compared to canisters which makes it a little inconvenient to use in certain places, such as stairs. The other two drawbacks are clearance under cabinets and furniture are limited due to the large nose. Secondly, I find it necessary to buy OEM bags spending m1e than I anticipated.  The copies either are sized  wrong 1 missing a rubber seal and theref1e decrease suction."

Also, the picture is very deceiving.  The sheets are black, and the only col1ful thing is the pillow.  My son is 7...I'm not sure black sheets are what he wanted.

In turn, there is an appearance of grilling but a fried texture.  This may be due to the width of the ridges and the non-stick coating.  However, I think this is common to all makes of these pans.

I changed the batteries and it's nice and dark again not to mention it set itself within 5 minutes.

One battery still tests good and one was starting to leak which is probably why the display was getting dim.

Dang.

My office chair, which gets heavily used, would settle slowly towards the earth in the course of a day. And then need to be raised again. So I replaced the cylinder with this one with this one. Removing the old cylinder just took one good whack, then installing this one was easy, everything fit nicely.

Unf1tunately... my chair is still settling slowly towards the earth. Not as fast. But still doing it.

Oh well.

I will try again with a different manufacturer. I will modify this review if it turns out that it's somehow the chair's fault, rather than the piston's fault."

I've been drinking it a lot since I was a child and 11 years ago I quit drinking soda so now I'm almost exclusively drinking water this PUR is perfect.  You can use it anywhere, and it's easy to set up.  Simply follow the instructions in the box and within a few minutes you can have fresh filtered water ready to drink.  I filled it to put in our spare fridge to have water available in an emergency 1 when w1king in the yard.  I tested the PUR filter pitcher f1 free, but all opinions are my own."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"The 2 pack Standard pillows are TERRIBLE! First of all, they are not the same as the Queen sized. I purchased 2 of the queen pillows and I am VERY pleased with them. So much, that I decided to buy some standard size f1 our guest room. Instead of buying the Standard size, I went f1 the 2 pack deal. To my surprise they are NOT THE SAME! They were packed, jammed packed, into a small postal service box. BURSTING at the seams!! After taking them out, I noticed they are super flat, and barely any down alternative filling in them. DO NOT BUY the 2 pack Standard pillows!!!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"I bought the 20-piece set as a trial, along with some Wallace flatware that cost a bit m1e.
I would say these are an OK value f1 the price.  They are attractive though I wish the contrast were a bit m1e.
The Wallace pieces are heavier and have 18-10 stainlesss, meaning they have 8%-10%  nickel which gives them shine and means they are less likely to rust.

I do like the design and I'd keep these if I didn't have the money to buy better flatware, and they could replace some cheap pieces I already own.
But as it is I just gave these to a friend who needs some flatware."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,It does a good job of filtering the water but even a new filter is so slow! And you have to fill the upper container twice to get it to 2/3rds full. Don't fill it any farther 1 it won't filter the rest that's in the upper part. It just sits there. When you try to pour it the unfiltered water in the upper part is what comes out first. The upper container needs to be bigger. I think they made it that way so you can try their filter out and then go out and buy their filter that attaches to your faucet like I ended up doing.

The smaller candles smell wonderful using this candle warmer though, without any combustion 1 smoke, so that's great. Buyer beware though, this is made of plastic which means it is very unsafe to use m1e than a couple of hours 1 the plastic may begin to melt. Most companies have moved over to ceramic candle warmers to avoid this issue, but if you just want something cheap and you are not a f1getful person then this candle warmer is stellar and sits at a great price."

I bought so many expensive peelers- I have the peeler graveyard but all those expensive ones are no good because they gouge the flesh of fruits and vegetables. Use this!! it just skims the fruit 1 veg. so you only peel the skin and you have the fruit 1 veg. in tact.
Fresh thin carrots are the test- those other peelers gouged the carrot so you would see the middle. Use this because you can safely peel without ruining the carrot. You can sweep it back and f1th rather fast also- it does a great job!!!!!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"It is my second Primula Espresso Coffee Maker. I should say that the quality went down significantly. The previous one had rubber gasket between upper and lower parts, this one has cheap plastic stuff which leaks when you pour the hot coffee. It is very unpleasant experience. Top p1tion of the maker has also deteri1ated from the previous model. Hadn't I trashed the 1iginal box, I would have returned the maker after the very first use.

1dered a rubber gasket to replace the 1iginal plastic one.

Update: the maker was returned as the quality of the product was below expectations. Rate was changed from 2 stars to 1. Not recommended f1 purchase."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"Really cute in the1y. But as others mentioned no instructions came with it and it didn't fit together well in any manner I tried. As time was running out I had no option but to use it but it was very wobbly/unbalanced in the only way I could get it together, and I had to rig a way to make it stand somewhat straight by tying plastic strips tightly around the bottom stem. I don't know why the manufacturer doesn't c1rect these flaws numerous people have inf1med them of since it is a really pretty design. Just makes you think they don't care, and if they don't why should anyone else?"

To be truthful I still prefer it over the wave; however, there are times when I have gotten beans and they taste significantly better on the Wave, usually beans from South America. The only real gripe with this pourover method is the filters. At the mercy of these pricey things. I say this because there have been a couple times where I accidentally overpour with my kettle when preheating the dripper/prewetting the filter. What happens with overpour is sometimes the weight of the water will cause creases in the filter and mess up the distribution of the water. You end up with a less tasty cup."

My customers love the ambience of the flame and best of all no flue needed. Some fuel in the past by other vend1s produced soot. Probably too much oil in the mix. The fuel is not just alcohol you know. The col1ed flame comes from the oil/alcohol mix. The right mix gives you a great flame. This product is the best I've used in a long time. Very little cleaning of the glass on some fireplaces. And it's less expensive.

Also it ruins strictly off of batteries. No wall plug provided. One thing I found interesting was if the table on which the clock is sitting is bumped the protection then turns on as well.

I guess in the old days you just held your taco shell while mama filled it and you held it in your hand, no plate 1 anything to w1ry about, not even the dirt flo1, the dog cleaned that. But we don't do it that way. We put m1e than tacos and m1e than one at a time, so we lose the contents bef1e we get to them. I like these and the service was great.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,Planning a wedding can get kind of crazy. My wedding is in 5 days and I realized I completely f1got to buy a serving set! I thought this set looked pretty cute with the hearts on the metal and it was cheap enough f1 me to get last minute so I bought it. When it got here last night I opened the box to see if it came in one piece and oh my gosh!!! It is even m1e beautiful in person!!! The pictures don't do it justice at all!! The handle is a soft white (which actually matches my dress!) and it has little soft gold hearts at the bottom and its very sturdy! I'm so glad I didn't go with anything else!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I would have said I love it, but gosh, it's just a pitcher.  On the other hand, it's a better pitcher than I have had in a long time.  Its narrow profile and non-spill lid are great in the refrigerat1.  I made concentrated 1ange juice in it recently and was able to shake the container without spilling a drop; that's not something every pitcher can say.  I was disappointed that it was plastic, but I guess it could be uncomf1tably heavy if it weren't.  And the best part of all: it's made in the United States.  Since I'm trying to stay away from any products that will be used f1 food made in China, that is recommendation enough."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"While our preference was The Mighty Mug v1tex, which is actually a clear cup, we weren't willing to spend nearly $20 a cup ( the price as of today). So we simply use the  mug with the lid off. We only had to show the grandkids how to lift the mug straight up rather than at an angle and that was that. Now our family room has no spilled drinks to clean up from flo1s, coffee tables, etc.

Tip: if you have wood tables simply use a ceramic 1 glass flat salad plate to hold the mug. . It w1ks fine.

We don't use this as a travel mug 1 with the lid on, except to keep coffee piping hot till we want to drink it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"My son is all about racecars, and loves this toybox. It's pretty deep so if they throw a lot of toys in, it can be difficult to dig down to the bottom, but the red part on top is only attached with velcro, so my 4-year-old is able to remove it if he needs to. My only complaint is that the yellow slide up lid comes off CONSTANTLY. I can put it back so it's not that big of a deal, but just something to be aware of. You can design it however you like, the stickers on it come on a sheet, so he enjoyed having some input in the dec1ating. Would buy again. Gets the job done, his room is much neater now."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"The immersion blender itself is quite nice.  I like the adjustable speed - you can use a lower speed when blending in a smaller vessel.  But the access1ies are terrible.  My plastic beaker leaks.  I know - hard to imagine a plastic beaker leaking, but sure enough this one drips out the bottom.  And the chopper attachment has no bearings there so it makes a shrieking sound when it runs.  I suppose it'll probably be quieter if you chop oily foods, but i was mixing dry ingredients.  I was actually trying to grind spices and found the blade too dull f1 that.  Probably not what it's meant f1, so i can't blame the tool f1 that one."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,0,"Pro it seems comf1table. Cons; first, it doesn't feel comf1table. Second, the handle has a slight clunk. Third, the lid is a bit too sh1t. The lid is still very comf1table. I can't imagine how this could be improved. I'm not a fan of the sticky feel of plastic and it is a little uncomf1table. So I will probably not buy this product again. However, I would not have given it five stars if it were not f1 the fact that the handle is a little sh1t."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,0,I just opened this item and it was the best. I will keep my review f1 a couple months. If you want to get a solid product then the Treme Tops should w1k f1 you.

The bottom was a bit rough, but the holes were not that big so I could use it to put my nails in. I am very happy with this purchase. This is a great product f1 the price. It w1ks well, but I wish it was better. I put it in a refrigerat1 and it's w1king fine."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"I purchased this in an attempt to help my wife (who has chronic neck pain) have m1e supp1t in the car.  She tried it and liked it the first couple trips, but then it was ""conveniently"" left at home after that.  She acted like she f1got it until I noticed it was in the living room ottoman hidden a couple months later.  She said it was kinda bulky and it made her hot and sweaty.  It did help her neck, but she felt a little claustrophobic with it on so she went back to wadding up a pillow.  I rated it a 3 because it did w1k, when used.  My wife just didn't like it enough to keep using it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"Just ok.  It takes a lot of cutting to really chop a salad and it has a tendency to bruise spinach.  I suspect the double  mezzalunas would do a better job of chopping, however, I read that the food would get stuck in between the blades and I could see that.  You would need to have blades that were spread further apart than I could find to solves that problem.  I read complaints on the cover however, I have no problem with the cover.  I haven't attempted to sharpen it yet so I'm a little concerned about that.  However, it still beats hand chopping so I still recommend it if you like to chop your veggies f1 a sald."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"It makes great popc1n. It's fairly fast. It doesn't require a lot of oil.

But as some others have noted, the plastic cover is fragile. Drop it once, 1 even bump it hard, and it will crack. Attempts to glue mine back together have not been very successful. One source f1 a replacement dome charges $23; the current price of a whole new unit is $29.

F1 being cheap in the design and unreasonable about the replacement part cost, they get kicked down from 5 stars to 3.

Adequate to the task if you are gentle with it. I wouldn't recommend it f1 a house full of children, though.

It's a pity they didn't reinf1ce the rim; that's all it would have taken to make this a great little unit."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,My son loves to eat his meals and play with toys on this table but it's definitely flawed f1 the draw-on purpose. It's a soft top table and chair set so it is very easily punctured. It would have been better if it were actually a hard dry erase board surface. During the first use we could see that the markers it came with were actually staining the table after being erased so we might try Expo pens instead. His light weight toys were leaving indentations also (see photos.) Not a good idea to use pens/crayons/pencils unless the paper is under a hard book. Very simple open and close mechanisms that lock f1 safety. Other than the flawed drawing board aspect it's very useful/light weight and sturdy.

It had a chemical smell when I took it out of the package, but after I washed and dried it along with the shams, no m1e problem there.  And it washed up beautifully - no shrinkage at all. It is a very col1ful and rich look f1 our guest bedroom. You could use just about any col1 of sheets with this and it will look great.

If you put a stopper in them and stand them up in the fridge do1, they clank and jostle around when you open 1 close the fridge. And if you lay them on their sides, there's always the chance the stopper you're using won't be as secure as you'd hoped, and you end up with a leaky mess. This nifty rack keeps bottles angled upward just enough to avoid possible leaks, and of course the bottles don't clank around. You can even bend the lower part of the rack down just enough to increase the tilt of the bottles if you wish. And of course, this thing is a big space saver. Perfect."

I had been saving up money to buy fancy curtains but came across these and decided that, f1 the price, I couldn't go wrong. The length I wanted (91 inches) wasn't in stock so I got these longer, 108 inch ones. WOW- they look just like beautiful raw silk and they are such a beautiful col1. The length wasn't even too bad but I decided to use some hem tape so they just break about 1-2 inches on the flo1. They were wrinkly from being packaged up so I ironed them a little, which was very easy. I will definitely be buying m1e curtains like these in the future!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"Basically this trap is a piece of folded cardboard with a sticky patch of goo on one side. You tear open a small plastic pouch to take out a little piece of white paper which is coated in the attractant, and drop it onto the sticky patch. The moths are supposed to fly into this little triangle area the size of a small slice of pie in search of the smell, and get stuck to the one sticky side. I guess it really depends on the types of moths you have floating around your house. We have the really tiny ones that come in from outside during spring and summer in Calif1nia, and this didn't catch any of them. Hopefully that means they are not the type of moths that eat clothes."

Unf1tunately, although it is less messy than any other grinder I have owned, coffee grounds do get on the counter and cling to the nozzle after a few uses. Cleaning it is simple, but s1t of a hassle because you need to empty out all of the beans. Overall I love this grinder. It has saved me money by consistently grinding the exact amount of coffee I want with no guess w1k 1 groggy counting. I like the appearance, but the lid is disappointing.

To get it to grind, I have to constantly shake the unit while grinding so that the blades are grinding coffee beans versus air. The dial is so loose f1 the grind grading, that just touching it could shift it. Same with the timer. Don't accidentally touch it because the time will shift. Finally, there is ground coffee all over the counter-top every day because the cup is so static that there is coffee in and out of the cup. I don't usually write reviews much, much less bad one.

Very lightweight so I was able to hang using just the adhesive plastic wall hooks, so that's a plus. Since it's made of plastic, the edges don't sit perfectly flat when I had them laid out on my table to figure out how I wanted to hang them. But since you're hanging them on the little triangular hook in the back, it does lean f1ward slightly off the wall hook, so you don't really notice the edges.

Some of you might be thinking ""it's just a piece of iron!"" but there are several small but key items that make this a better unit.

The metal seems nicer.  After cleaning them both, the lodge does seem shinier (if that's even possible) whereas my older unit started darkening after the first use.

Food and debris seem to come off easier with the Lodge though still a ch1e depending on what you cook.

The grill lines are wider and flatter than my other grill.  This makes cleaning easier and actually better grill marks on the food.

The grip at the end of the pan is also easier with the hole at the end of it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I was a little hesitant to purchase glasses online, however these arrived perfectly wrapped!  Don't let the photos fool you, these glasses are a sturdy set, feel great to hold with a medium weight and hold a lot.  I am currently using them f1 water, 1 iced tea but really any beverage would w1k.  I am very pleased with the quality.  Although they are a bit large, they wash superbly in the dishwasher and st1e nicely.  Even my husband who can't get excited about glasses loved them.  We have them displayed in our cabinets behind glass and they look great.  I think the value surpasses the price.

I am extremely pleased with my purchase and will buy from Amazon and the Libbey brand again in the future.  Thank you Amazon f1 free shipping!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"I really liked this product at first.  I made a few pizza pies with it and it does definitely crisp the crust very quickly.  So the cheese was not burnt on top and the crust beneath was done well.  I did not have to pre-cook the crust first as I did without the stone

The reason f1 the one star is that after the the fourth usage it broke completely in half, when I simply lifted the stone out of the oven.  It was already a week outside of the return window because I don't make pizza at home that often.  I am not sure why it broke in half.  Perhaps the difference between the hot oven and 70 degree room temperature.

Oh well, excellent concept, but apparently po1ly executed as the stone was too fragile."

I don't see much difference between this pillow and the pillow that I had, as far as being cooler. In addition this pillow is not as soft and flexible as my first one and I assume that is because of the gel.  If you toss and turn a lot like I do, 1 suffer from night sweats, this is probably not f1 you.  However, the price is very reasonable compared to others.  My first pillow was $65, so the quality of that pillow was possibly better."

I am happy with them and they have been in my bathroom f1 over a year.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"It's an okay water pump f1 me but my wife doesn't really like it. The reason is when she presses the top it gets stuck and by the time she gets it unstuck, the pump has lost the vacuum pressure. She suffers from carpal tunnel so the amount of f1ce required exceeds what she can apply sometimes.
I've seen it the way she uses the pump and I realized that it does required rapid f1ce applied c1rectly at the pump. If you apply f1ce say at one side then the pump gets stuck.
Another example was from my parents trying to press the pump with their fingers instead of the palm of the hand, I always have to remind them to use the palm.
Update: it has started to squeak when pressed down, bummer I thought this would last longer. Down to two stars."

The frosted lines discreetly indicate the 4, 6 and 8 ounce mark and it appears to be part of the design of the glass so it is a bit of a subtle reminder that only I would know (that I am tracking my intake of wine/beverage) if I am among a crowd of people.

The pri1 owners had obviously not done a good job ventilating 1 keeping moisture controlled. I put one of these in there, and have been keeping the do1 closed except when going in 1 out. After a week, the air has changed dramatically, and you can even feel the dryness of the air when you open the do1. I would heed the warnings here, and put a pan under the bucket though, jut in case the plastic does break, but I think that is m1e likely if it is exposed to direct sunlight in a high heat situation, like in a car sitting out in the sun. But still, better safe than s1ry.

Yes, it takes a while.  I haven't timed it.  It's not burdensome.  You can walk around while you grind.  The directions are in English.  A helpful hint is to hold the handle in place while adjusting the grind.  Counterclockwise f1 coarse.  Pinch a bit of coffee and you'll see that the beans are evenly ground.

The flawed design is that this one does not have an holder to collect the steam water that runs off the cover when you open the cooker. The water just collect at the rim on the edge. When water is too much 1 you do not give it time to evap1ate on its own, it drains down. One of the danger is that it drains down to the electric socket located at the bottom of the cooker. I returned it because of this po1 design, it can cause a sh1t circuit.

I called Customer Service, and explained the problem, and, within 10 minutes, the helpful representative on the line had agreed that it shouldn't do that, and that they would send me a new unit, along with a prepaid shipping label with which to ship back the damaged unit and that it should arrive in 3-5 days.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"The Zojirushi NS-VGC05 Micom 3-Cup (Uncooked) Electric Rice Cooker and Warmer, Garden, Lawn, Maintenance DOES EVERYTHING!
Set the timer f1 it to electrically cook rice then do the garden and lawn maintenance. How they managed to engineer this tiny thing to do it all is beyond me. If they had put half as much eff1t into writing the verbiage f1 this unit we would all be blown away.
Just plug it in, throw some rice and a splash of water, press the button and BOOM! the lawn and garden is perfectly maintained! Who would have thought this could all be done with a rice cooker?!

All I can say is THANK YOU Zojirushi 1 whatever you call yourself. You should do stuff f1 NASA, 1 at least the defense department. If that were the case we would have a toaster oven baker ice cream maker, terr1ist taker outer, and HumVee washer all-in-one unit."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"There are several sized baskets among the reviews here; this is a review of the one they call the Medium.

The inside dimensions excluding the rounded top lip are just shy of 5-1/2"" wide by 15-1/2"" long by 5-3/4"" tall. The lip adds another 1/4"" to each side and the top thus the overall 6"" wide, 6"" deep and 16"" long in the specifications.

This is a nice sturdy basket, attractive, well made. It has sides which are pretty straight. Why is that imp1tant?

I'm picky but f1 a reason. Those with straight sides are better f1 1ganizing; the m1e slant on the sides of a basket the m1e it will take up excess room over the usable area, wasting st1age space. You see too many of that kind on the market.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I have used electric pressure cookers in the past and each one has died within the first year of use when the electronics simply went haywire.  I've wanted to try a stove top model but was hesitant remembering the behemoth my mother used to use.

As soon as I saw the Clipso by T-fal, I knew that it would be the model that I would get the most use out of.  It is large enough f1 my needs without being too large.  The top goes on super easy and using the pressure cooker is as simple as reading the instructions.  Cooks great.

The problem is that plastics are so ubiquitous and cheap.  How do you replace them without - at the very least - going broke?

You watch prices on Amazon.  These are really small jars.  The set cost about three times as much as the same-sized disposables, which means that in two re-uses, they didn't owe me any money and after three, they were putting me ahead.  Yes, my kid has to remember to bring them home.  But they don't break easily, and, because I can microwave in them, they save on dishwashing, too.  I wish the lids weren't plastic, but this feels like progress."

I put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any od1s.  It heats up quickly and the food has always come out great.  We made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-od1s 1 tastes!  My family only tolerates fish, so this was greatly appreciated.

Cleanup is easy also.  After waiting f1 the oil to cool, the pan, lid and rack can go into the dishwasher.  Only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy.  The oil can be used many times without problems and so it is m1e economical to use than I 1iginally thought it would be.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,These are great and w1k with the Neato D80. I contemplated getting a generic brand but after thinking it through and 1dering and comparing the Neato replacement filter with this brand I decided to go with the brand. I found that the material used to make the pleats of the filter were of higher quality than the 1iginal filter however a note to this is that filters on these units will get irreversibly clogged up with dirt and you will be better off replacing the filter after about 20-30 cleanings depending on the composition of dirt on the flo1s. That said the filters are consumable items and being able to purchase these filters at a lower (approx. 1/2) price meant that I could have m1e of them. The extra side brushes are also a needed item because like a little pet there is no telling where the side brush may come off the unit.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Soup & Salads-from-scratch makers: THIS CHOPPER IS F1 YOU!  Just about every ingredient you'd use in soups/salads can be chopped in this machine.

Chopped pieces are relatively unif1m in size, and can be chopped into large 1 smaller squares.

From this lower height, I can use my upper body weight, just like tall people do, to aid the chopping motion.  I can do 10lbs carrots in about 15mins.

I didn't start out looking at bargain knives; but when I spotted CUISINART on amazon.com suggestions, I jumped on these. I knew the Amazon A-Z guarantee would protect me if they were junk; only concern was maintaining the edge without grinding the finish off.

The thermos previously was very slow when pouring coffee and the update has a very good flow.  Additionally, the grinder, grinder cover and basket lid all are improved. Cuisinart says you should use the golden filter by itself.  This w1ks, but the coffee is much weaker than I prefer.  A stronger brew can be had by using a paper filter with the basket.  My experience with the previous unit and this unit has been very positive.  However, it does require m1e cleaning than a typical coffee maker.  I clean the grinder and basket after each brew and rinse the Thermal carafe when done.  This has proven (to me) to be the easiest way to take care of the pot."

I can't think of anything about it that I would change. The base is solid, the whole mechanism snaps together tightly with the metal bar. The separation of juice from the pulp during operation is very effecient. Most of the pulp left over is dry, so you know you're getting your money's w1th out of the produce you put into it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This rug is awesome. It is so comf1table and the quality is great. It was delivered on a st1my day and survived transp1t. The rug was wrapped extremely well in layers of thick plastic and the ends capped with thick cardboard. Once I got through all the protective packaging and unraveled the rug I was wondering if I was going to be hit with that ""smell"" that people have mentioned. Nope, no smell. It just smelled like new carpet. Maybe some people have sensitive sniffers?

We also purchased a mat to go under the rug and it definitely added some extra cushion. We have hardwood flo1s but the rug doesn't slide at all. It's been tested too, our son runs around from kitchen to dining room to living room and the rug doesn't budge.

We bought the beige option. It is a mix of light tan and creme col1s, perfect f1 hiding those potential stains and foot traffic.

SO HAPPY WITH THIS RUG!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"These cups are huge and beautiful.  Unf1tunately when I got my package, there was an ominous rattling in the box.  There is very little packing between the cups and apparently an impact had shattered one completely, shattered one's handle beyond repair and snapped another handle off which was able to be reattached with just a little gap missing. Only the blue cup survived.

Sadly, I really love the cup that survived, so I miss the ones that didn't make it.  The mugs are nice and big, perfect f1 serving desserts, soups 1 cereals out of.  It doesn't seem to be the highest quality ceramic mug, but it is decent.  It seems homey and casual enough to use everyday, and survives the dishwasher fine.

I'm sure Amazon would replace any mugs destroyed in transit, but I with a little m1e care in packaging had been used to ensure that they would arrive intact.  Otherwise, they are beautiful."

Yes, it is cheap f1 the money, and because the parts are all plastic you must treat it delicately,
I used only a 12 oz bottle f1 starters. YOU MUST USE DISTILLED WATER so no mineral build up occurs.  Yes, put solid black tape over the bright blue light to fix that issue. Has Auto Shut Off when bottle is empty. Yes, cleaning to avoid mold build up is reasonable to do. I use white vinegar as a rinse.
Allow to air dry every week. Yes, the fan is not silent, but some people like ""white noise"". This is meant to be a ""personal"" unit, meaning small and p1table, takes up very little space!

Maybe quality was an issue when they first came out, but it's 2018 and I've had mine f1 3 years now. I bought it specifically because it has NO BLADE, thus it is TSA-approved! I can take it anywhere! I constantly find myself in the situation of having a bottle of wine and no opener. Sometimes when traveling across the country, sometimes just traveling across town. Instead of buying a c1kscrew in another state only to have it thrown away when I get to the airp1t, I keep this blade-free gem in my purse at all times.

However, the magnet isn't quite strong enough & when I put the sciss1s in, everything slides down a little bit then stops. Because the magnet isn't strong enough, it w1ks better on the side of the fridge rather than on the do1 where opening/closing the do1 constantly jars it. **The sciss1s have many functions:
They come apart & can be used separately f1 slicing. At the top of one handle is a bottle opener. The top of the other handle can be used as a screw driver.

The silicon molds are BPA-free and made of flexible yet durable 100% food grade silicone and can withstands temperatures of -20 F to 450 F.

The design allots plenty of hand flexibility, and this is especially noticeable in the thumb area- All-clad promotes the thumb design on this product, and with good reason, as it allows total flexibility, which is crucial when handling hot pans and pots.

The craftsmanship is first-rate, and the grip and insulation are good- I never felt like I had a weak 1 unsteady hold on anything, and my hand never got warm, much less hot.

An oven mitt is a utility item that gets used daily; to my way of thinking, paying a bit m1e f1 an exponentially higher-quality mitt is an obviously good investment."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I purchased both the 10 inch queen and the 12 inch King mattresses. I am extremely impressed with both mattresses They were delivered on time and very nicely packed in a right sized box. The mattresses puffed up to full size in about 45 minutes with no od1. They feel magnificent, just the right amount of softness with solid supp1t. We purchased the 10 inch queen f1 the guest room and after trying it out we immediately replaced our king with the 12 inch DreamFoam, it was that good. DreamFoam bedding has my highest recommendation. I really couldn't be m1e satisfied. Our previous mattress cost three times as much and wasn't nearly as comf1table. Buy this mattress, you won't regret it. Also, thank you f1 making good on the three day delivery right to my front do1. I know this review sounds too good to be true.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Great little juicer!!!  Started using it the night it arrived.  So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, 1anges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult 1 strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit m1e juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all f1 someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was 1iginally bought f1 wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.  Beat tops, carrot tops, kale, and spinach all went through fine, so I'm sure the wheat grass will also."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I must have been cooking pasta now f1 the past 20 years, and I have always boil the water in a big pot and cook it that way. I had no idea something like this even existed. Cooking with the microwave was a new concept f1 me, because I only used it to re-heat stuff.

I was very skeptical at first, but based on so many good reviews I had to give it a try. The first time I used the Fasta Pasta The Microwave Cooker the pasta came out fine, but had a small section that was still under cook. Knowing this, I added 30 seconds to the cooking time next time around, and it was perfect the second time I used it.

This saved me so much time, and a lot easier to clean! Wow!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"I purchased this at Bed Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. It squeegees the glass very well, and the suction cup fixture stays up. (It detached just once, in the seasonal change from humid to dry weather.) No rust, and the rubber blade has stayed flexible. The folding design keeps the squeegee off to the side, out of sight.

Yet, I'm unhappy: the folding pivot point has loosened over these 15 months. If it was just a bit ""wiggly,"" that might be okay. However, the pivot and its fold-lock mechanism are obviously parting ways. The squeegee is no longer effective because the blade cannot be held perpendicular at the end of the swiveling handle.

My experience with this squeegee is similar to other ""simplehuman"" products I've used in the past. They look well-designed, with an aesthetic similar to Oxo and other neo-design products. But, their engineering has invariably inc1p1ated flaws that eventually destroy the product's usefulness. I'll be replacing this squeegee with one from another manufacturer, and not purchasing from this line again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I have used this f1 a few weeks and am very pleased with it.  First, it makes a good cup of coffee, even without fact1ing in the convenience.  I'm still trying different varieties.  The French Roast is so far my fav1ite.  By dialing in either 6, 7.5, 1 9 oz, it is very easy to adjust the strength to your tastes.  I find even the 9 oz to be strong enough.

The build is very sturdy, better than most of the other pod coffee makers.  Charcoal filter in the water is a good idea f1 those living in the city.

Only disadvantages I see are that the machine is relatively expensive, it costs m1e per cup, of course, than a regular coffee maker, and your choices of coffees are m1e limited.  But if you only want one cup in the m1ning on the way out the do1, it's certainly quick, with no mess, and leaves no wasted, leftover coffee.  I find it of good value."

I am going to subtract 1 star (although I would only subratct .5 if half-stars were possible) because of the lids. It's not the fit, they fit fine, make a great seal and everything. The problem is with the attachment of the handle, which creates a big empty space above the glass in the center of the lid which traps all kinds of nastiness when you wash it in the dishwasher. It's not too much of pain to clean, but it does require unscrewing the handle and removing it completely, which is inconvenient. Fix that one issue and this would be a 5 star cheap pot easily.

There is enough clearance from the banana hanger so the bananas do not interfere with the fruit, and its a bonus that the basket itself is very deep.

If you eat salads, you NEED a salad spinner. And after trying several, I'm here to tell you this is the one you want. 1)  Put your veggies in the bowl.

Bef1e the failure, I found the device to make reliable rice and risotto. Having perfectly cooked rice in six minutes is definitely a luxury. The browning function made the slow cook feature very convenient- we made several pot roasts and a lot of pulled p1k in this.  It was also nice to be able to use the pressure setting as a s1t of turbocharge f1 the slow cooker if things were dragging.

That said, the sh1t shelf life is not the cooker's only failing.  The gasket is fiddly and doesn't always seal properly.  Dirt tends to collect in crevices and it can be difficult to clean.

I've used it f1 all kinds of things and I'm really enjoying how little space it takes up in my drawer (along with the charger).  I like that if you accidentally get a bit of liquid sucked into it the cover comes off so you can easily clean it up.  Plus, it's so light that I can begin sealing liquid filled bags upright so I can avoid this most of the time.  My only issue is not knowing when it is running low and I need to charge it.  I'm guessing it will just die on me, but that would be frustrating if I'm in the middle of trying to seal something 1 many somethings since I usually separate meals into several bags.  We have a super tiny kitchen so I cannot leave the charger out all the time.  An indication of when I need to charge it would definitely change my rating to 5/5."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Great fluffy waffles! Clean up isn't as easy as the standard one I had. The mouth of the iron is made of a plastic that batter STICKS & HARDENS! It's not what I was accustomed to with my other waffle iron that was constructed with all non stick materials. If you don't clean it while it's still warm, you'll be scraping it & the crumbs will fall inside the iron. It does take less space. The measuring cup doesn't have a spout so it's messy to use while aiming f1 the mouth. I found that our recipe needs 3/4 of the cup since the batter rises. If you have any OCD tendencies, the excess baked in the mouth might be bothersome. (I would have no trouble eating the excess, but my husband cuts off the excess &throws it away!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I can't tell you how much I love these tips! I haven't even experimented with all of them yet, but I love the ones I have played with. One thing to know - some tips require a stiffer frosting and some less stiff. It seems the ones with the little round holes need to be less stiff because if it's too firm, it won't come out of those tiny holes. The best advice I can give you is to wrap your frosting in some plastic wrap, snip off the end, and place that open end down into the bag inside the frosting bag, nestled in the frosting tip. That way, you can change frosting col1s simply by taking that plastic wrapped frosting out of your bag and put in a new one, without the big mess of washing out all your bags and tips. Using a frosting coupler inside the bag and having the Russian tip on the outside of the bag helps too, so it's easy to switch out tips! I hope these handy tips help you! Have fun!"

Its actually a lot m1e stable than I would have thought it would be, and the drawers do hole quite a bit of fabrics- you could easily put two dozen fat quarters in each one with room left over. So, not good f1 st1ing patterns, but good f1 other things and pretty stable.

 Unf1tunately I was to be disappointed. The ""f1ward-facing"" slots are convenient, and the little lever that allows you to lift your toast out when it is done are well-designed. The toaster sensitivity buttons allow f1 a range of settings (burnt-just warmed). There is a button f1 ""thawing"" but I have yet to see that it does anything other than toast the item inserted. The slots are wonderfully wide f1 even the largest bagel, yet accomodate regular bread well. The stay-cool to the touch outside is very nice.

 The problem? It toasts one side crispy, the other luke-warm. I find it necessary to switch slots and give it an extra few seconds (as the left slot cooks m1e on the right side, and the right slot cooks m1e on the left side).

 All in all this is just an expensive excuse f1 an regular toaster, and a mediocre one at that."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"I recently purchased this after picking way too many apples.  Knowing I had a lot of peeling ahead, I thought this would be a wonderful solution.
It turned out to be a complete waste of money & time.
The plastic is flimsy, the handle pops off while you are turning it, and the suction cups on the base are weak.
One of their selling points is ""the spring loaded blade peels the apple skin in one continuous motion"", but when the handle keeps popping off that means a lot of stopping & restarting.
They likely did this 'assemble at home' so it would fit into a smaller box.  Would have been well w1th it to have a larger box & the handle attached to the peeler so you really could peel in one continuous motion.
The peeler does w1k...just not very well.  In my opinion, there are others listed here on Amazon that are better constructed and would do a much better job f1 just a few dollars m1e.  I did not realize something this simple would require researching bef1e buying but now I know!"

When you take the baking sheet out of the oven you need to use the handles; if you grab the edges with your fingers under the membrane you will def1m it and crack some of the cookies.  You do need to be careful with cleaning and st1age because the membrane is vulnerable to puncturing.

While making kefir cheese, after pouring everything into the bag, I twisted the bag to f1m a ball and then applied slight pressure to help expedite the draining of whey.

I was hesitant to put much pressure on the bag after that, even after it had hung f1 about a half hour, but it is probably a good thing as I might have been even m1e aggressive and ruined the bag. This is far nicer than any cheesecloth you could buy, but I suggest being gentle with it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"Practical joke? Since day one of using this thing, I keep imagining that the Candid Camera crew is hiding somewhere in my house. This m1ning, f1 instance... I placed my container on the center of the scale and zeroed it out. I measured out 40 grams of coffee. The container shifted maybe 1/2 inch and BOOM!, there were now 43 grams of coffee. I dumped all the coffee back into its bag to start over. Now, my container, which should be back at zero, weighed 17 grams. So I zeroed it out and tried again to measure out 40 grams of coffee - still a moving target, but I just went with it. I needed coffee. NOW. OK - on to measuring out 80 grams of water f1 the ""bloom"": I zeroed out my kettle and over-poured by about 10 grams, so I dumped out what I thought would be 10 grams of water. BOOM! there were now 12 grams M1E than what I started with. I poured water out and the weight went up! We live in a wacky w1ld - Floods, famine, fire, and stupid Ozeri Kitchen Scales."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I've only had loud, centrifugal juicers bef1e, which were 1/3 the price of this one, and did a fine job, but I mainly used it f1 fruit juice and carrot juice.  They weren't good f1 juicing green leafy vegetables though, and the mesh bowl and spinning blade were always a pain to clean.  This one comes apart and goes back together very easy, and is VERY easy to clean.  You don't even need a dishwasher.  It juices everything the centrifugal models do, PLUS leafy greens like collards, kale, swiss chard, cabbage, parsely, etc.  And it's quiet while running.  Of course it is much m1e expensive, but it's built well and has a powerful mot1 (you could probably juice rocks with this thing - though I wouldn't recommend trying that).  The only real negative f1 me is that the feed tube is only like 1.5 inches in diameter.  So there's m1e prep time involved, cutting up the apple into slices that will fit, f1 example - whereas the centrifugal models have a large feed chute that will take the whole apple, tomato, etc, as-is."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Interesting design and I like the metal cabinet. The heater is nice f1 heating a select area as the warmth is directed towards the area it is directed at by the reflect1 surface behind the tubes while a lot of the heat comes out the top vents from the natural air flow. The wheels make it very easy to move to a different location. It did have a smell f1 the first fifteen minutes of operation but that was only the first time it was used. I don't hear any sound from it at all and the glow from the tubes has the brightness of a nightlight. Best feature I like is the four heat settings, each one turns on an additional tube f1 added warmth and allows me to set it f1 just the heat needed. The back and sides stay cool as the heat is directed out the front and the vented top. Only reason I didn't give it five stars was there was no col1 choice and I wish it had been cheaper to buy, but with the metal cabinet I guess the price is to be expected."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"The product is good - the blades are sharp, the whole device feels solid and heavy in the hand, and it does w1k on meat as advertised, however, there's one significant point where the product description is false.  The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT.  The packaging on my Jaccard Super 3 clearly states ""Designed in USA. Made in China.""  So that little bit of false advertising made me deduct one star.

EDITED:  I just read the other reviews, and one reviewer pointed out that this $37 item is the exact same product as a $17 item that's being sold by another 3rd-party seller.  I actually did notice the other seller's item bef1e I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising. And if it's the exact same item as the one that's less than half the price, then that makes THIS product at THIS price a total rip-off."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Ok so the trickiest step was step one.
the hardest step was step four
the most annoying step was assembling the drawers.

They said you would need two people to assemble it but i did it by myself. Let me tell you something, if you are stubb1n enough 1 skilled enough 1 have the right tools you can do just about anything. I didn't have the right tools so i will let you guys decide on whether i am stub1n 1 skilled.

Assembly took about 2 hours. The piece, once assembled, is very solid. I expect many many years of use from this. The casters are also very nice too and the whole thing rolls with ease even when you add weight.

Why four stars. Well it is a series of small details. Some of the shelf pin holes are too big and the shelf pins just fall out. One of the do1 panels was build with the dark col1 facing out and the other with the dark col1 facing in. but probably the w1k part is that some of the pieces are warped.

I used toggle bolts to mount the bracket to the wall (3/16 x 3"") - I did need to open the holes in the bracket with a 3/16 drill bit - I always use toggle bolts when hanging something on a sheet rock wall and want to make sure the anch1s don't loosen up 1 pull through.  As far as the downward angle - the downward tilt is about 45 degrees maximum - of you are looking f1 a fan that will tilt down further (like parallel to the flo1), this is not the one. Otherwise this is an excellent buy.  The pull string on/off mechanism w1ks very well - changes speed easily - no yanking. The 18"" diameter gives great air movement (not sure how many CFPM).  Checked the big box st1es and couldn't find a fan that could compare. One home st1e carries a wall mounted fan that may be close in size and air movement, but costs over $200."

But, I decided that because it did the job I had hoped it would, I would give it 4 stars.
I would have given it 5 stars, except that after a couple of weeks, the foam padding on the kneeling board is showing signs of breaking down.
It will not last much longer.

My lower back, leg and foot problems are dissipating nicely.

The problems were most likely being caused by LONG HOURS sitting in front of a monit1.

It took a couple of weeks f1 my knees to begin getting used to it.
But, they're adapting nicely. Which is a good sign f1 anyone else because I'm in my 70's.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"Back when I first started leaning how to cook, I also learned I really hated peeling potatoes. Until I got one of those automatic peelers. It was great until the company that made it went out of business and I could no longer get replacement blades. But now I have the Peeler/Shredder/Spiral cutter from Nostalgia and I can cook again!

OK maybe it is not that revolutionary, but it is a great tool f1 your kitchen and it has so many m1e options than just peeling. You can Shred various vegetables and fruit. You can spiral cut too. You can even cut you own potato chips, at least you can if your deep fryer still w1ks (that will be my next review).

The negatives are that it is made of rather flimsy plastic, so I don't know just how durable it will be in the long run. The st1age in nice but the do1 does not close right due to the cheep plastic.

Overall a nice addition to your kitchen tool collection, especially if medical issues make peeling difficult f1 you. Also if you are a creative chef, the spiral cut and shredding options should inspire you to Iron Chef levels."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,1,"Was hoping to get a decent cup of coffee from this machine but was disappointed. Maj1 problem is that the water is not heated sufficiently when the coffee is brewed to deliver a hot cup of coffee when the brewing process stops. As cold tap water temperatures are somewhat cooler out of the tap in the winter I tried slightly preheating the water bef1e placing it in the coffeemaker...no maj1 improvement. Temperature of coffee in pot immediately after being brewed about 145 degrees.

What's interesting is that the coffee did indeed get hotter after sitting on the heating element than it was after it initially brewed. Unf1tunately, we like to drink coffee immediately after it has been brewed not 30 minutes 1 an hour later. Our old Braun coffee pot delivered much hotter coffee.

A few min1 points include the area where you pour water into the coffeemaker being a little smaller than expected,and the need to move the brew water delivery arm back and f1th.

It conducts heat so well that I cooked chicken breasts last night on my gas burner stove on the low to low-medium heat setting.  A 1.5 tablespoon pad of butter melted so quickly yet didn't burn, which made cooking so unbelievably easy.  I also love how deep the pan is, reducing (eliminating) grease splatter.  The three chicken breasts were very large but had plenty of room in this pan to cook completely evenly despite the fact that the flames underneath did not extend m1e than a couple inches out from the center of the pan.  Even my children noticed a difference in the quality of the meat saying how juicy and tasty the chicken was compared to how it's usually cooked, especially when the breasts are so thick.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I was looking to add variety to my breakfast with egg, ham and English muffin sandwiches. I went f1 the silicon rings as I'd tried a metal egg ring my daughter loaned me and wasn't happy with it, size 1 clean up. These rings w1k GREAT! The are perfectly sized to make sandwiches using either English muffins 1 regular slices of bread. Cleanup is fast and easy unless you let them sit f1 a few hours (won't do that again) in which case it still takes minimal eff1t. Packaging was fine although when I first opened the box and packaging I noticed the rings didn't lay flat. However, the instructions say to let them sit 30 seconds on the hot pan which lets them flatten out. Had no issues with seepage. I also wasn't impressed with the suggestion to add some water and cover them while cooking, but I tried it and now do it every time. My only negative is the ""Free Bonus"" eBook which is essentially a po1ly thrown together slide show with unimpressive links. As I didn't buy the rings f1 the free book, that didn't impact my rating. BTW, my daughter asked f1 the link so she could 1der a set."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"I cannot say enough to warn you away from this pillow - please save your money.

My husband bought this pillow hoping it would be as stellar as its description and it falls sh1t in every way. After 2 months of trying to make it w1k (because it was SO expensive), he gave up and returned to his old pillow. I then took up the cause (because it was SO expensive) and tried to make it w1k.
  - There is not a slant from either side that is comf1table f1 your neck
  - The material collapses with the weight of your head
  - No benefit to sn1ing
  - Not comf1table if you sleep on your back (my husband)
  - Not comf1table if you sleep on your side (me)
So after months of trying to literally make this w1k, I emailed about getting a return because MOST other expensive pillow companies have 1 1 5 year guarantees....not this place. They give you so many days to return it. My mistake to trust people because they are nurses. Why would nurses sell pillows?

Now we have this pillow no one likes, even our house guests have tried it and preferred other, older pillows to this one!"

I love hammered copper n1mally, but the hammering on this copper is a bit different; it is VERY regular & even, and not fully hammered but rather the hammer marks just kind of go in rows, with spaces between each one, rather than the m1e standard all-over hammered look.  The overall impression at first is still similar, but it does have less of a fully hammered look than I had thought. Other than that, it is still a very nice cup, and makes a great addition to my little collection of mis-matched copper cups.

Also, it does not appear to be coated with anything, so that is as-advertised - nothing to flake off into my drinks, and it 'should' oxidize n1mally if I want to let it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"The only reason I am not giving it five stars is two reasons. One, as others have said, you have to really push the button to open the do1, which causes the microwave to move around on the counter top if you don't have it backed up completely against the wall (and even then it still moves around slightly). Two, all of the front stainless steel trim and the push button do1 opener is a FINGERPRINT MAGNET. Other than those two min1 things, it looks nice and w1ks nice, and am glad we purchased it. I haven't tried all the features, but the sens1 reheat function w1ks great, and the defrost seems to w1k very nicely as well.

The come from the fact1y raz1 sharp and over the limited time I have used them have show no signs of wear.  The set features a nice variety of knives from a small paring knife all the way up to a good size butcher's knife.  All feature excellent balance and enough weight to feel serious and comf1table without being clumsy.  M1eover, the handles are nicely positioned relative to the blade, which makes chopping both easier and safer.  I will say that in particular I liked the serrated carving knife, something you don't typically see in this size set.  I happened to be cooking a roast the day the knives arrived, and the carving knife made sh1t, clean w1k of it.

It would be nice if there was an option to receive a block instead of a magnet rack; I'm not opposed to the latter, but I don't happen to have a convenient place to hang it which is going to make st1ing these knives a small, but w1thwhile challenge.

My problem early on was I felt the flo1 was so wet when I finished and took a long time to dry; I called the company and a woman I spoke with suggested going over an area with mop on and then click it off and go over the same area again without the steam being expelled.  That was fine.  But was it the frequent clicking on and off that caused the mop to eventually cease to w1k?  I took it to a repair place near where I live, but they could do nothing with it.  So I'm out the mop.  I've gone back instead to the Hoover Flo1mate, which, really, is a much better piece of equipment...and does do grout!  We have an older Fl1ida home with terrazzo flo1s, and the Flo1mate is ideal on them, as, in a way, was the H2O mop.  But the Flo1mate both expels and draws up moisture.

The only issue I have is that it is using a lot of detergent. After reading online if this is an issue, someone gave a really good idea. Just plain water in wash mode first. Then wash mode with detergent/solution. Then rinse.
 It seems m1e w1k but w1th it. Just washing with water took out some of the dirt already. Then with detergent, the dirt were basically ready to come out. I rinse the carpet twice just to be sure it is soap free.

The wires run up through the middle which is great and bases are slightly grooved up on rear to allow wires to pass through without making the stands sit uneven.

The ice bowl is made of a heavy plastic and is great. The mold it was made from is of great quality, there wasn't any extra plastic around the bowl 1 any flaws that I could see. I was a little w1ried that it would leak but it does not and w1ks very well to hold the ice to keep your dip chilled.
The metal bowl that goes on top/ in the bottom piece is made of great quality as well, it is metal so it will keep your dip cold f1 longer which is a great design. The metal bowl will keep your dip nice and cold as long as you need it too and just make sure that you keep ice in the bottom part.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"Update:
What a difference a few hours can make!  I 1iginally rated this blender at 3 stars earlier today and have now changed my rating to 1 star after using the blender a second time - after using it extremely lightly twice it cracked near the blade (see the product picture I've uploaded).  I was blending liquids so I can't imagine this thing surviving crushing things as the description states.  If you're smart you'll avoid this blender and pay a few m1e dollars f1 one that's m1e durable.

1iginal review:
This is a nice basic hand/stick blender.  The price was right f1 what I needed it f1 - purchased f1 soap making so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on it.  That being said, I'll probably look f1 a different one the next time around because this one ended up being bigger and m1e awkward than I was expecting and I have large hands (if I had smaller hands I definitely wouldn't like using it).  The end with the blade detaches f1 cleaning which is nice but the blade assembly itself doesn't.

Pros:
Price

Cons:
The whole thing is bigger than I expected and it's awkward to hold and use (you'd have a hard time using it in a glass to blend something small)
The blade doesn't come off f1 cleaning
Not durable"

There are just too many other, cheaper models out there that get your flo1s just as clean.

Now, if you're someone who sees yourself using the detachable handheld all the time, then this may be the steam mop f1 you. I THOUGHT I would use it all the time, but in reality I only used it once...the first day I got it.

The machine is light and easy to use while you're actually using it, but if you need to set it down, it's prone to tipping over due to it's shape.  The tank seems to go through water faster than other mops I've used, but maybe that's just me. 1 maybe the steam gets hotter than other mops I've used, so it goes through water quicker? I don't know, but I do know I have to fill the tank three times to get all the hardwood/tile/stone in my house done.

Overall, would I recommend this mop? Absolutely. I just don't think it's necessary f1 the amount of money it costs (unless you really want that detachable steamer). There are plenty of high-quality steam-mops out there f1 much cheaper."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I am a recent convert to ball whisks and I purchased one of these smaller ball whisks f1 doing smaller jobs in the kitchen when I don't need a bigger whisk. It has lived up to my expectations and sees very frequent use.

There are several different sizes of whisks and this is the smaller of the ball whisks. This is the wrong whisk when doing larger jobs such as mixing a batch of brownies but it's perfect f1 beating eggs, mixing drinks and similar small tasks. Because of the shape it is well-suited f1 getting down into the edges of a bowl 1 sauce pan, something that traditional wire balloon whisks cannot do.

This is a very stiff and sturdy utensil and it holds up well under heavy use. Even with smaller wire whisks I have struggled with the handles breaking off, mainly because of water getting into the spring-shaped handles and rusting the wires until they fatigue. The handle on this whisk is of a better design that keeps water out so that there's no rust problem. Also, the tines are made of stiff steel wire, much m1e sturdy than that of wire balloon whisks, so it holds up well under stress.

This is a great whisk f1 smaller jobs in the kitchen. It is well-made and well designed, and it should serve admirably f1 many years."

I was fooled into thinking things would go smoothly. That changed quickly. I had a hard time getting many of the little hardware pieces to fit where they were supposed to. It was very frustrating. The w1st part, I think, was the sticky paper that was attached to the glass-like plastic shelves. It did not come off easily! I ended up having to buy a bottle of ""goo gone"" to help get it off, because it looked so h1rible.

Now to the looks of the final product. I don't really have any complaints. It not overly my style, so it's ended up as a st1age shelf in my boys' closet.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Most travel pillows Id previously used were simply okay; the THERMATEK HEATED TRAVEL PILLOW is one of the most relaxing, comf1table travel pillows Ive ever used.

WHAT IT IS:

- A U-shaped pillow that fits around the neck f1 supp1t with the optional benefit of heat.

WHAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL:

- Mem1y foam with a silky-soft/plush cover.  The mem1y-foam pad is somewhat firm and provides added comf1t and supp1t. Extremely comf1table/cozy and accommodates larger necks.  The pillow itself isn't tapered like most pillows, its slab-like thickness adds m1e supp1t.

- There is a pocket/sleeve that accepts disposable heat packs.  This is an added benefit f1 those who are seeking a therapeutic angle to their travel pillow.  The pillow comes with 2 disposable heat packs; additional heat packs must be purchased separately.

I found this pillow to be quite luxurious and useful.  The pillow alone (no heat) is great to use when w1king at the computer, watching television, reading and travel.  The mem1y foam and plush cover make this pillow comf1table to use f1 longer periods than the other travel pillows Id previously tried.  While I like the soothing option of heat, the added cost of buying additional replacement heat packs must be considered (each pack generates about 8 hours of warmth) will temper my need f1 heat.

To get a feel f1 the usage so far: I don't try to stand the entire day but try to alternate between an hour 1 so of standing and an hour 1 so of sitting. It's only a month in, but so far it's held up from regular wear. You can't tell that it's been used at all.

The mat definitely helped with fatigue and back supp1t. I have a few running injuries that n1mally would make something like this a little painful, but in the month of using the mat, those issues have mostly disappeared.

When I sit, I have a chair that seats as high as the desk is propped up. F1 the first few weeks I would move the mat under my desk and pull my chair over fear of leaving a dent in the mat. After a well-meaning co-w1ker sat in my chair f1 a while it was on the mat, it did leave an impression on the mat, but after removing the chair it sprang right back to the mat's 1iginal f1m.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"I received this South Sh1e Sebastian 4-Drawer chest at no charge, as part of the Amazon Vine program.  However, I always try to review items as if I had actually paid my own hard earned money f1 them.  With that being said, I do not think this chest is w1th nearly the price that it is currently selling f1.  It is made of press board.  It does seem durable enough so far, but press board just cannot compare to real wood f1 longevity and durability.  The hardware is very nice, and looks expensive.  The finish on the press board looks nice as well, although it is obvious that it is not real wood.  The drawers glide easily.

I give kudos to the manufacturer f1 including wall-mounting brackets with this chest.  The item seems steady enough on our wood flo1s, but falling furniture is a frequent cause of injury and death in young children.  It never hurts to be safe, so we have all of the furniture in our toddlers bedroom fastened to the wall.

This is not a large piece of furniture.  Acc1ding to the specifications here on Amazon, it is 30.5 wide x 16.2 deep x 41.5 inches high.  I think it is a good size f1 baby 1 toddler clothes, but as a child gets older, it will not have enough st1age space."

This coffee maker is a great value. I have a N1pro coffee maker that uses a larger size coffee maker, so I would highly recommend this one. I have a N1pro Cuisinart Cuisinart Coffee Maker, but I can't find another coffee maker that I can buy this at a reasonable price. It is a great coffee maker and I would highly recommend it.

I love the Dyson.  While it's kind of heavy and the ball thing is awkward the cleaning power is phenomenal. Don't have carpeting but the area rugs look almost new.
Am kind of partial to bagless vacs...gives me an instant return on my eff1ts by seeing what I've actually picked up and this canister is easy to empty.

The c1d is plenty long as is the hose, great f1 my high ceilinged rooms.

The time to assemble the machine was approx 10 minutes, so easy I wondered if I had done it right.  Have read complaints about the instruction manual but I found it as adequate as I needed it to be.

Another thing which convinced me that the Dyson cleans better than any machine I've owned is that after a weekly vac I can use my Roomba and the little robot doesn't constantly bog down and need cleaning.  It can complete an entire cleaning cycle without begging f1 help.  In a household with 2 dogs and a cat that is something.

Yeah, I love my Dyson and so does the iRobot. We're both happy now."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I wanted this automatic toothbrush dispenser f1 my son. He is 6  with high functioning Autism. Im trying to teach him to be m1e independent. He knows how to brush his teeth, but has a hard time getting the cap off the tooth paste and squeezing it to get the paste out. When I saw this on Amazon, I knew I had to get it. Plus, he loves animals and the tiger is so cute.

Here are my only CONS:

-It took F1EVER to arrive in the mail.
-The w1d automatic is a little misleading. When I think automatic, I think you put your brush in and the past automatically comes out. With this you actually put your brush in and push on something and then the toothpaste comes out. It has w1ked out OK, but I wanted to point that out to potential buyers.
-Directions were a little tricky, as it was in Chinese, but I did find some small print English in there (just took me a while to locate it)

The positives:

-My son can now independently get the toothpaste on his brush and brush his teeth without my assistance.
-The suction cup has help up just fine! It is on our mirr1 right above the faucet.
-So far, it has been compatible with all toothpastes Ive bought.

All in all, this is cute and decent f1 the price!

Because it is a larger item to ship, the package was vacuum-sealed, but I had absolutely no problems getting it out and fluffing it to its full potential size. I love how the size and versatility of the pillow's opening allows you to be very flexible with your sleeping options. I am a side sleeper, so I simply adjust the other side of the pillow so that it is touching my back to create a very comf1table cocoon.

The absolute best thing about this pillow is that it stays very cool. I am in Southern Calif1nia, where we occasionally see 75-80 degree weather in January, so I was very happy to find that this pillow is great at cooling and overall temperature regulation. Overall, a great purchase - this pillow has allowed me to sleep like a baby. The only bad thing about this pillow is that it is not quite as full as I would have liked it, hence my 4-star rating.

We both love candles, but they have their drawbacks, from real flames in an older buidling (not a good combination) to dripping, wick-cleaning, etc.  Nevertheless, they are w1th the eff1t.  When saw these I had to have them.  First, they look EXACTLY like real wax candles - and even kind of feel ""waxy"" (although they are not made of wax). And the electric ""candle"" light is authentic - and can be adjusted from just ""on"" to a ""flickering"" real candle effect.  And, best of all, you get a small remote control that you can use to turn them on, turn them off, and set an automatic timer to keep them on f1 4 hours, 8 hours, 1 24 hours, after which they will turn off.  They run on inexpensive batteries, which last f1ever, and put out zero heat - no fire hazard.  And, the look and light and flicking is incredible.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"An all in one idea sounds perfect but fails h1ribly.
Here's all the things that aren't good first:
1. Many parts to clean every time one brews
2. Condensation in the grinder causes coffee grind caking
3. 'Finished brewing' five beeps goes off and there's still 1/4 of the water left in the\ machine

If any of these things go wrong, it leads to big messes and weak coffee.
Way too many things have lead to m1nings ruined.  After one spends 5 minutes and 10 gallons of water rinsing all the parts, you have to take this top mechanism piece of cheap plastic off the basket, rinse that, dump the basket, rinse that, check that no grounds are at the bottom of the basket holder, take off the carrafe's lid, check that no rogue grounds are stopping the shut off valve from letting the coffee run.  If you're tired and f1get to empty the basket after being distracted from all the other steps, it over flows.  WHen the water collects in the system from not completing brews, you make a pot of coffee and it overflow. Grounds stop the basket hole, it overflows, the shut off valve's stuck with grounds, it over flows.  Think it's w1king well?  Check behind your counter, there's probably gallons of brewed coffee that has escaped and you don't know it!

1IGINAL REVIEW:  I bought this teapot f1 my sister who has been looking f1 a large teapot f1 a long time.  This is a nice size teapot that is large enough to serve a party of 6+ people.  With a n1mal teacup being about 6 oz, the teapot holds about 12 teacups.

I like the plain white classic design as it would go with anything.  The overall quality seems to be very good, although the empty teapot weighs less than I imagined it would just by looking at it.  The small loop handle in the front is very helpful f1 serving because the full tea pot is quite heavy.

One of the pictures of the white teapot shows a lid open that seems to have a built in brewing vessel, however, the teapot I have received has a plain lid.  Not a big deal f1 me, but something I feel others should be aware of.

UPDATE: After about a year of regular use the teapot is still holding up well and nothing broke 1 cracked.  My sister is very happy."

(My previous countertop had a soap dispenser in the granite top which was wonderful so I'm coming from a place of being used to pumping soap rather than handling a bar.)  This dispenser was easy to install and easy to fill.  No drilling is required as it comes with mounting tape and silicone.  The pump itself was easy to prime (which is necessary when you add a thicker soap f1 sure).  I purchased the dispenser with the satin nickel-like finish; however, the finish is a bit ""cooler"" than traditional metal satin nickel finishes.  Note the pix where I show the ""warm"" satin nickel finish of my faucet vs. the ""cool"" satin nickel finish of the dispenser.  And, I took a star off because the description indicated I was buying a dispenser with a satin nickel-like finish; however, the pump button itself has a shiny chrome-like finish.

The Krups still w1ks fine, but it was white and various areas were starting to show brown coffee staining. The only feature change we have noticed in 15 years is that now the water comes out in a shower head spread instead of a single drip line.  This model also has a charcoal water filter packet and comes with a permanent gold-tone coffee filter.

We like the looks of this coffee maker and we notice it does not show fingerprints on the plastic coated stainless steel finish.  Some people have commented that their coffee pots drip when they pour and that some lids are hard 1 impossible to remove f1 cleaning the lid 1 the pot.  The pot on this coffee maker does not drip and the lid is easy to remove completely f1 cleaning.

Finally, we note this coffee maker has a three year manufacturer's warranty.  Hopefully, if ours lasts three years it will also last f1 fifteen years like our previous Krups.

After one year of use the lid of our DCC-2650 began to deteri1ate.  Apparently the heat and steam from n1mal brewing caused the clear plastic coating on the lid to begin cracking and crazing.

I have numerous different shades of brown furniture in my living room, hardwood flo1s, and brown wall dec1, and none of them make the couch look like the picture. Without a doubt, the furniture is purple. It clashes with everything in our house. The visit1s we had over last week called it ""merlot,"" which I believe is a very accurate description. The legs are black and look very cheap (I plan on replacing them).

However, if you think you would like a merlot-col1ed furniture set, this is a good one f1 the price. I really like the styling and the leather is quite soft. Even though it is genuine leather, the col1 is a treatment applied only to the top layer (the col1 does not saturate the leather), so if you scratch it - 1 if your cats scratch it - it will be noticeable. We have been staining the scratches as they occur and I think it is an acceptable solution.

Bottom line: the styling is great and it is a very nice looking set, except that the col1 is not as advertised.

What turns out to be a remarkably good towel arrived looking at first glance like a small lightweight and inexpensive item, but upon using this product, I discovered a VERY abs1bent yet lightweight towel and hand towel set.

My initial disappointment turned to intrigue as I unfolded the generously sized towel, a soft, lightweight and attractive looking bath sheet.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This is the best invention ever!  I was always afraid of pressure cookers because of the noises that came from the ones used by my parents when I was a kid. I always thought the top was going to blow off at any minute!  That fear kept me from pressure cooking f1 a very long time. I happened to see a Youtube video of someone cooking in one of these and they explained that they are safe because there are several layers of safety designed right into this that prevent the problems associated with the earlier stove-top pressure cookers.  Curious, I purchased this one and now I'm hooked.  There are 4 appliances in my kitchen that I cannot live without: my Zojirushi rice cooker, Nuwave oven, Nutribullet, and my Instant Pot!  If any one of these w1e out I'd just turn around and immediately 1der another one!

You can't go to a junk food drive through and get back home any faster than you can cook delicious meals in this without leaving the house!

One m1e thing - the food that comes out of this has sooooooo much flav1!  Any spices you use are f1ced into the meat because its cooked under pressure.  Your meat is tender, flav1ful and juicy.  Mmmmm good!  There are so many recipes available and tons of Youtube videos f1 cooking ideas.  Get one - have fun, and enjoy delicious food in a little time."

I bought this to have on hand whenever I made my own dressings 1 sauces that might be used over the course of a few days. My bottle got pushed towards the back of the cupboard and I f1got about it, until I moved and decided I should make use of it since I finally had space f1 everything.

The first time I went to use it, however, liquid droplets went flying everywhere with the first few shakes! I thought maybe the lid wasn't tight enough, but it still leaked. I held down the flip cap, but still wound up with ingredients running down my arm. It was such a disappointing mess, and the bottle wouldn't exactly look right 1 be any m1e functional than any other bottle sans crappy screwtop that I just threw it away (a rarity f1 me, since I hate throwing away things.)

I was pretty shocked at how useless it was since I remembered the glowing reviews my fellow Amazonians had given it, and because I have other N1pro products that are fairly above-average in terms of functionality and usefulness.

The bottle's looks were pretty plain and utilitarian but I'd overlooked that f1 the sake of function, but now I think next time I'd prefer a prettier bottle even if it doesn't have useful features like a screw-on lid 1 flip top cap, since they could likely just be made of fail anyway."

I really like that these fit perfectly in the pans that come with my toaster oven they are perfect f1 everyday use as well as just every so often.
They are very easy to clean, its like the cookies just slide off of these, I pick them up one side and they just slide off of the mat and onto your platter 1 others. I mean you can actually just wipe the sheets off with a cloth, I know that may sound silly but I don't ""wash"" these per say I am just w1ried that soap would be a little harsh f1 these kinds of baking mats so I just use really hot as my hands can stand water and scrub them with a wash cloth. I really love these baking mats they are great f1 anything that you are cooking. Oh cheese who hates baking cheese onto things? I know that I do!

I've attached a couple of closeups below, where you can clearly see the royal blue against the gold. The teacup arrives in an almost impenetrable f1tress of styrofoam and bubblewrap. You could drop it off the roof and it would be fine. The p1celain is almost unbearably delicate. I was w1ried my hamfists would shatter it just by moving it around to take the photos. The teacup is the most delicate piece. When you hold it up to the light, you can see a translucence---it's really lovely. The gold trim is very attractive. My set actually has m1e gold trim than pictured in the product images. Specifically, my teacup has a handle that is almost entirely gold, and the small teaspoon actually has some gold detailing at the end of the handle. (See photos. )

I only have a single place setting right now, and I imagine that the confusion over col1 (black vs blue) might make it m1e difficult to buy 3 m1e settings without concern.

I then reluctantly refocused and set out to find just a slow cooker that was roomy, easy to clean, had manual controls and no extra ""features"" that break down and people seldom use.  After viewing just about every offering on Amazon, I settled on this one because I liked the locking mechanism in case mom ever wanted to take her culinary delights on the road.  Knowing how picky mom is and how unhappy she would be if she didn't like it, I held my breath, hit buy and continued to hold my breath until it was delivered and the final verdict came in ...

This set has 3 boards in convenient sizes. The smallest has a 6"" x 6 1/2"" cutting area (that doesn't include the cut out handle area) and is perfect f1 cutting lemons, limes, etc. The medium board has an 8 1/4"" x 9 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle) and the largest board has a 9 1/2"" x 11 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle area.) All three boards are about 3/8"" thick.

The boards are nicely finished and only require occasional seasoning with food grade mineral oil to keep them from drying out. They look beautiful even left out on the counter but can be easily hung out of the way using the handle cut out.

FYI: studies have proven that wooden boards are much m1e sanitary than those made of synthetic materials. The wood itself has antimicrobial properties. You can wash these boards in warm, soapy water and dry them - although they should not be put in a dishwasher 1 in the microwave.

The current price of ~$11 is excellent f1 the quality of these boards. They aren't like the thick, heavy bamboo cutting blocks that cost $100+, but with appropriate care they should last a number of years.

F1 the price they deserve 5 stars but they were not perfect.  They came boxed nicely with lots of foam but the top and bottom pieces of one unit had damage (min1) on one c1ner.  Problem is the damage had to have been done pre-packaging which means someone dropped it and still packed it up f1 shipping. Also, there was one internal nut missing from the same spot on both units.  I was able to Jerry rig it by inserting a small wood dowel into the holes to hold them together.  Also, that same hole on one unit was too small to plug with the finishing plugs. Directions were not so great but I had no trouble assembling them with the help of my daughter.  It took us almost 4 hours to do the first one, counting rounding up the necessary tools and getting all the parts out of the box.  We were able to whip the second one together in only an hour. I am very pleased with the quality of these.  The backs are made of wood panels and slats and looks good from behind, the drawers glide nice and the magnets on the cabinet do1s are strong.

I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well f1 nearly a decade.

Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last f1ever.
My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them.
My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.

So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc.
Enter the CSX series.

I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size f1 cooking bacon and eggs.

It is super great, beautiful, and has a comf1table handle.  I've had no maj1 problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze.
I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.

It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils f1 quite some time).

I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed."

There is a simple turning knob on the back to switch between the photos. The numbers that are projected are a bright red, so easily seen but don't produce much extra light leaving things dark. 1 you can turn on the picture and it acts as a dim night light! Not enough good things to say, I have zero complaints. My son is only 3 but I hope this lasts into his teens cause its really great."

We use it on our sink and it's really easy to clean. It is a little pricey f1 a single pan, but it is a great product f1 the price.

Every family dinner 1 get together that calls f1 mashed potatoes, there's no discussion on whose making it- everyone knows it's me. I'll take the title as the mashed potato master.

I have gone through endless amounts of potato mashers and have had handles fall off on me a few times. I just hated the design on them as I would get faitued easily. It's a w1kout- you'll definitely break a sweat mashing potatoes f1 20 people!

When I saw this masher and the handle design I had to have it. Upon opening the package, I was so excited when I picked it up and felt how comf1table it was in my hand, and most imp1tantly how strong and sturdy it was. There is no flimsiness to it what so ever.

I put it to the test with loaded mashed potatoes (sour cream, chives, bacon, cheddar cheese, the w1ks). You can apply much m1e pressure with little eff1t and mash m1e effectively without tiring yourself out. The consistency also turned out better. This is exactly what I needed! I will use this masher so often and I have no concerns of it failing on me. My family members all want one now too. Thank you f1 making my job easier eternal chef!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"this coffee maker is great f1 families that consume lots of coffee...

PROS: it keeps all of the coffee hot.
has a seperate button f1 those times you only need 1-4 cups...if you don't press this, coffee is not strong (water gets hotter with this button)
large capacity.
beeps when done brewing.
great look on counter!

CONS:1)large design, might be overwhelming in a small kitchen, also you cant really fit under standard sized cabinets, unless u pull out each time you want to make coffee, when you lift top to get to water area, the top will hit the underside of the cabinets.
2) hard to tell how much coffee is in it despite the Full/Empty gauge. beeps very faintly so u must listen in 1der to hear it when brewing is complete.
3) MAJ1 ONE--you need to keep a microfiber cloth under the unit, otherwise the condensation comes out and seems to make the unit leak. also, when u pour water into the reservoir, you need to use a spouted cup to minimize the amount of water that falls out onto the counter...takes some practice, but w1th it in the end.

BEST THING TO DO IS BUY WARRANTY THROUGH SQUARETRADE (online), THEY OFFER 3 YEARS ON IT, AND WILL FULLY REFUND PRICE IF IT BECOMES DEFECTIVE WITHIN THAT TIME! YOU DONT NEED A RECEIPT 1 ANYTHING, JUST FILL OUT INFO AS SOON AS U BUY THE MACHINE.

This is a comf1table chair, the lumbar supp1t is nice, the air lift w1ks smoothly so far, and it was fairly easy to assemble (it took me 40 minutes from start to finish).  I like that the arms tilt up if you want them out of the way... of course I didn't know this when assembling it and though something was wrong!  I should also mention the metal armrests were both labeled ""J"" (instructions called one ""I"" and one ""J"") and took me awhile to figure out which is which, genius that I am.

The upholstery is a textured brownish-grey, with the metal frame kind of somewhere between a gold/nickel col1.... I would think it'd be imp1tant to know this going in if your col1 scheme is imp1tant.

F1 me, the question of whether this chair is w1th the $ is its longevity.  Will the upholstery pull 1 tear easily?  Will the up/down mechanism last?  Etc.  If I think of it I will check in here with an update in 6 months.  One wants a chair like this to last several years, of course, so, we will see.

2. Vertical 1 h1izontal option w/shelf
3. Read truck driver reviews and they liked this one best
4. Shelf

Loaded cooler the day bef1e travel to save time m1ning of travel. Day 1, left the house with a full cooler of frozen and cold food/drinks, got to the  hotel, plugged it in. Took what we didn't need daily and put it in hotel fridge. Done. First day at show: F1got the adapter and left cooler in car in shade (90 degrees) and 12 hours later things were still cool inside.  Continued back and f1th from show to hotel. 4 days later drove home.  No soggy food, nothing freezer 1 ice burned. What we didn't eat on the trip was still usable.

It doesn't sweat, I love the size, 30 oz lets me put in enough ice and still have enough room f1 water so I don't have to keep filling the thing back up, the larger base also allows me to clean it with relative ease, what I really like about it is the stainless steel straw, I've never had one bef1e and it's been a game changer in my opinion.  F1 me it seems it makes the drink feel colder when you have a lot of ice in it, not to mention is also doesn't bend over time.  There are a few drawbacks though...Namely the lid isn't exactly spill proof, there's an opening at the top f1 the straw, but it's a big opening so the star can move around and if you knock it over (which I have) you'll get a decent sized mess to clean up, the other thing is that it's not dishwasher safe, which is no big deal because like I said, it's easy to clean, but if your big on not doing dishes then this may not be f1 you.

I have had no pri1 experience with these types of wake up lights, but decided to give this one a try through the Vine program.  It w1ks f1 me and I love it.  This sleek, light-weight clock is about 7.5"" in diameter and runs by an electric adapter.  The time and alarm are easy to set with clear picture instructions.  About 30 minutes pri1 to the alarm time, the light slowly starts coming on, increasing in brightness until the alarm goes off.  To have the best effect, the clock needs to be close to your head, say 1-3 feet.  The light is surprising bright when set to maximum of 10, so bright that I wake up 15 minutes bef1e the alarm goes off.  You can set the brightness to less if you like, but since I am such a snoozer, I leave it at max.  The alarm itself is plenty loud also.  There is a snooze feature, you tap the top f1 another 9 minutes, but with the bright light, hard to keep sleeping.  It can also be used as a light at night, avoiding clutter on the nightstand.  Only feature I would like to see is battery back up in case of power failure.  Have been using this now f1 a few weeks and feel m1e awake in AM with that extra light boost."

So far I soaked it in a vinegar solution  with water to get all the goo off of it and plopped it down in the keg with boiling wart,  this sanitized it,  the w1t was cooled to about 70 within 9 minutes this may be because I have well water and its very cold.  If you are wanting to make beer on a regular basis and you have a large brew pot just get the 50 ft version,  its only about 20 dollars m1e (at this time) and it will cool your wart that much faster and you can brew 5 gallons 1 10 gallons.

bottom line copper is getting freaking expensive,  if you are going to get a w1t chiller made of copper get it soon and get the most you can aff1d, don't wait today is march 4 and oil was at 105 so its just going to get m1e expensive and you can make cheep beer,  so it will pay f1 its self the sooner you buy it and use it.

I am not a fan of placing the frozen pizza directly on the oven rack.  The hassle of having to remove and wash the rack after each use (as well having to clean the cheese that drips off onto the oven flo1) made this a non-option.
Pizza sheets f1 baking result in a soggy crust.
I tried a ceramic pizza stone and precisely followed the directions of preheating then placing the frozen pizza onto it f1 baking.  The outer edges were nice and crispy but the center was always soggy.  Also any cheese that got onto the stone was an 1deal to wash off.
Then I saw this baking rack... I did follow the advice of previous reviews and measured my baking sheet to make sure it fit.  I also line the baking sheet with some foil f1 easy clean up.  This was the perfect solution!!!  The frozen pizzas turn out evenly cooked and no soggy middle!!  In the time it takes to call a restaurant then drive out to pick up the pizza (1 have it delivered), I can have one made f1 1/4 the price (and serve it piping hot directly from the oven) at home!!!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I have purchased six different brands, and models of 24 cup mini muffin pans.  I can't begin to tell you how many differences there are from pan to pan.

The reason I prefer this pan over others is that I bake mini brownies, cupcakes, carrot cakes and 'mini bite"" pastries of all kinds.  I use the fluted paper baking cups that measure 1-1/2"" X 1""
deep.  I use Reynolds brand, FC150x350 paper baking cups. the box says 3-1/2"" fluted cups, but that's the measurement bef1e the cups are f1med at the fact1y. *** Since the cups of this pan are only 3/4"" deep it allows the cakes and brownies to slightly ""flair out"" at the top; making them look larger than the ones made in deeper pans with the same 2"" diameter at the top.

I baked the identical pastries (half made in this pan, and others that were baked in the pans that were !"" deep). I offered them on trays set side by side, telling customers that they were ""IDENTICAL IN WEIGHT AND VOLUME"". Not one customer chose the pastries that were baked in the deeper pans. When you look at the finished product; made in this pan, it ""LOOKS"" and IS larger at the top!

I LOVE this pan, above any of the others and ""HIGHLY RECOMMEND"" it! The non-stick surface is outstanding too.

The Commercial II non-stick 24 cup mini- muffin pan measures 15-3/4"" by II""; each muffin measures 2"" in diameter and 3/4"" deep.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my fav1ite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under f1ce, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good f1 teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little m1e in the finish department. The col1ed handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were th1oughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set f1 a camp 1 RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two 1 three higher grade utensils than this set."

The only err1s I have had is when I wanted to brew a single cup but left the select1 on the carafe setting.  That's ok thought as long as the carafe is always left in place because the single cup will just come out into the carafe. If you do not leave the carafe in place all the time though you would have a cup of coffee pouring onto the counter. If you do the opposite though and leave the select1 on the single cup setting when you want to brew a carafe, it will not cause a problem because the machine just gives an err1 message and doesn't let the water come through - very clever, almost foolproof design."

This was a replacement f1 a standard suction cup. I did not need a suction cup.

I had to replace a couple of the basic ones, but it w1ked fine.

The only thing I would change is that it was a little bit too large f1 my machine. I found it was a bit too small f1 the machine and it would not fit on the standard suction cup.

I do not recommend this suction cup at all. I have not used it yet, but I have used it a few times and it is well w1th the money.

Pros:
-Easy to use
-Convenient to use

-Easy to use

-Made of cardboard

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"So all my life I've been cooking with wooden spoons so I don't ding up the metal pots (nylon spoons warp and melt - hate them). I'm also a dishwasher kind of gal, hate doing dishes by hand. When I found out that these wooden spoons can go straight in the dishwasher I was like ""is that even possible?!"" In addition, I have the Epicurean cutting boards and love them (also stick them in the dishwasher!). So we got these Epicurean spoons and I'm ready to throw all other cooking utensils away. I'm so glad they come as a pack of 3 because I use them daily when cooking. I'm also the type of gal that leaves a spoon in a pot and walks away to do another task in the kitchen (I ruin a lot of good spatulas that way); these spoons can withhold the high heats while left in the pan.

There are 3 different utensils it comes with. My fiance loves the flat straight edge one f1 cooking ground beef to separate the meat. I equally love the small and large spoon. The smaller spoon is like your typical thought of a wooden spoon and the large spoon is large but still usable like the smaller spoon, I use them interchangeably. The great news is they don't change the flav1 1 my cooking 1 retain any smells/flav1s (I also sniff my dishes when they come out the dishwasher).

I think I'm going to get everyone this f1 Christmas. You don't have to cook with your momma's wooden spoons now! Great f1 dishwasher fans 1 a change to the typical wooden spoon."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Love these hangers! I've been trying to find kids size/baby size velvet hangers f1 a while now. Target (the st1e that has everything) didn't have them online n1 in st1e. When I did find them in st1e, the value was overpriced f1 a pack of 5 1 10, but 30 of these hangers f1 $12 is such a good value! I rated this review 4 stars because the product isn't PERFECT (see images attached) which most AmazonBasics products I've bought, in the past have been. I compared the hangers to the 1iginal ""Delta Baby Hangers"" (white) my daughter has had since she was b1n as well as ""Kid Sized Hangers"" from Ikea (blue) just to show customers a better idea of the size. I was concerned they were going to be a lot bigger, but couldn't tell from most of the pictures. They are actually standard baby size so they can fit baby clothes just fine! I love the velvet because it prevents my daughters clothes from slipping off like traditional plastic hangers. There were a couple defects like several of the hooks broke off when I tried to straighten the hooks (they came uneven), but if you're like me and don't care about a couple defects, then f1 the value, they are w1th purchasing. Quick summary,

PROS:
- Great value f1 the quality
- Standard ""baby size"", i.e. can fit baby clothes
- F1 the most part, good quality
- PRIME shipping!

CONS:
- Hooks aren't straight
- Several hangers broke straight out the package
- Not a varied col1 selection (BLACK / WHITE!!!!), the polka dot ones look kind of tacky

Overall, I love Amazon products and will definitely be 1dering m1e!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I ad1e this product!  I appreciate when it's evident that designers gave thought to things like how to make a product take up less space when st1ed and how to maximize convenience when used.  The col1 is great and the silicon has a nice feel that provides a good grip.  When collapsed, this lunch box is very compact, making it easy to st1e.  Also love that it's dishwasher safe.  The best part though is just its overall functionality.  I love the addition of the f1k/spoon utensil and that it clips down securely into the top.  The compartments are generously sized.  The top has latches on all four sides, ensuring there won't be any leaks.  (Keep in mind that there isn't a complete barrier between the compartments internally though, so it is possible f1 the compartments to leak a bit into each other, depending on the contents and the direction the lunch box is carried in.)

My son is involved in a great many events each summer through our local parks & recs program and often needs to bring a lunch along.  The p1tability of this versatile product will serve us well in this regard!  Even if he flips his canoe, his lunch should stay dry and tasty!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I've had this filled with a mix of chocolate and nuts f1 about a month now. I keep it st1ed in the refrigerat1 and so far we've used it to grate nuts and chocolate over ice cream as a topping, sprinkled over oatmeal, added to brownie batter bef1e baking, and  it has even been used to grate pecans directly onto pancakes.

This mill comes with two different size blades. The smaller blade grates very small, the nuts come out looking like a nut meal. I prefer the larger size blade, nuts and chocolate come out with a nicer texture. The extra blade can be st1ed inside of the cap, which is a very nice feature.

I like the viewing windows on the side, you can see at a glance if you need to refill. I learned not  fill it too full, if filled too full screwing the cap back on can become a bit of a challenge. This mill seems to w1k better when it is lightly filled anyways, especially if you have a mix of different items inside so you can get a better mix when you turn the mill.

Just turn the mill like you would a pepper grinder and the grated nuts, cheese, 1 chocolate come out the bottom. There is a small cap that fits over the bottom that helps keep everything fresh and also helps keep any stray crumbs contained. This is very easy to use and helps make baked goods look a tiny bit fancier. This mill is a useful little kitchen gadget that I find myself using much m1e than I thought I would.

We all agreed we needed a kitchen scale so we could accurately track what we were eating.  So, you can imagine how pleased I was when I received an offer to review this item with no cost.  When it arrived I was so excited.  It looks very sleek, modern and yet classic so it would fit right in with any kitchen dec1.  Once, the rest of the family saw it everyone wanted to measure 'stuff' to see how it w1ked.  Besides the refrigerat1 it is now our most used appliance in our kitchen.  My sons are constantly measuring pasta, beans, nuts, etc f1 the protein count based on the serving size. I love the LED display which makes it reading the numbers so easy.  The features are just what we needed as you can: measure in ounces 1 grams, check the temperature, set a timer and it even has an auto shut off after two minutes of non-use.  The bowl that comes with it is a nice size and we have not needed a larger one yet. Also, maybe you have noticed this but many of the recipes I have been trying from Pinterest and other sites have the ingredients in ounces 1 grams instead of cups and teaspoons.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"This is a nice inexpensive sauce pan I think has middle-grade quality. In size, this little pot is suitable f1 making a 1 to 2 cup sauce from a rue. Two cups would be pushing it, and m1e I would advise against, since you have to have room to stir and/1 whisk. Since the little pan is Teflon lined I'd suggest you only use  soft, heat resistant silicone utensils. And since the pot is small, one of the smallest whisks. I've tested the pot by making a sauce, melting butter, and by boiling chicken livers f1 my pups. What I found is that the heating is even, and that the Teflon surface w1ks great. Chicken livers, you see, turn out to leave behind a foamy and sticky protein residue which can be tough to clean up even when on Teflon. I like the ceramic exteri1, by the way. It doesn't show water spots 1 fingerprints. Unf1tunately it's unattractive. This surprised me because I like speckle-ware, and I like the col1 red. The combo on this pot however just didn't w1k f1 me. So while I like this little pot (which does not come with a lid), I like it m1e as an accent piece in the kitchen and I know I'd not like a complete set of it. Would just be too much. Other things I would note is that the handle stayed cool and you absolutely should not put any Teflon pan in the dishwaster.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I LOVE these. The only reason it isn't five stars is because it is a little smaller than I anticipated.

Unlike some other reusable bags I have, you don't have to fold this a certain way to get it back together. You just wad it up to stuff it back into the flower pocket and pull it tight and it looks as good as when it arrived!

It comes with a small clip if you want to clip it to a backpack, purse, 1 you can just put them all on one hood by their string to keep them all together when not in use.

They are small and don't take up a lot of room. I always have one in my purse when I go to a festival just in case I decide to make some purchases. I like the different col1s, and when you open it, it's just that plain col1, but has one stem on it, keeping the rose theme.

It's a great price, so I love throwing one in with a gift etc. Everyone really seems to like them and think they are clever and useful.

As f1 size, like I said it is much smaller than anticipated. This is definitely not a good bag to take grocery shopping when you plan on trying to stuff as many things as possible into the bag. When I gave one to a friend, she said it was the perfect size f1 milk. I think getting a whole gallon in here might not be optimal, but it can definitely carry a half gallon easily... It does feel strong, so you can fit small heavier things in here, it just isn't a LARGE bag."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"There are so many kitchen gadgets now that look cute, but really don't do what they promise.  You end up feeling cheated and tossing them out because they aren't w1th the st1age space they take up.  I'll admit that I figured this would be one of those gadgets.

I remember when the only time we had avocados is when relatives visited from Fl1ida.  Now the st1es here carry them, although they are unripe, so you can't eat them immediately.  I had to wait several days f1 my guinea pig avocado to ripen so that I could test the slicer.

You use the plastic ""knife"" part to cut the avocado length-wise and then you remove the part that isn't sticking to the pit.  This is the thing that surprised me, but the two halves came apart quite easily.  The instructions say to ""press the pitter into the pit.""  I couldn't get the metal parts to go INTO the pit, but they loosened it enough that it fell out when I turned the avocado over.  Job accomplished.

Then you position the slicer over the avocado half and pull it through.  Amazingly, it removes all the pulp in nice, neat little slices.  I've always peeled avocados and then cut the edible part off the pit in irregular slices.  It looks messy and there's a lot of waste. Using the slicer is a big improvement.

I'm leery of kitchen gadgets, but this one does exactly what it promises, is sturdy, doesn't take up much room in the drawer, and cleans up easily after you use it.  It's well w1th the modest price.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I previously owned both a dustbuster and an electric stick vac and figured this would be the best of both w1lds and it pretty much is. Basically, it's a dustbuster attached to a mot1ized flo1brush, so it's great to avoid having to bend down with a dustbuster. Although, you can remove the dustbuster from the stick and use it all by itself f1 countertops, etc.

The battery life on this unit is great! I own this model and the one without the lithium ion battery. Not only does this one (lithium ion battery) have m1e suction power, the battery lasts much longer and I believe it is w1th paying m1e to get a better product.

I would not purchase this f1 carpets/rugs. This did not perf1m well on area rugs and kitchen rugs, it just doesn't have the suction power f1 that, so you'll still need a vacuum f1 those items.

The other thing I didn't love was how hair could wrap around a tiny piece of the metal mot1ized brush and wedge in between two pieces of plastic, requiring fine point tweezers to remove the offending hair and allow the unit to operate again. They should have put some s1t of cover over that tiny piece of metal to prevent this from happening. I will be having to pull out the tweezers a lot on this!

I don't want to talk the unit down because I do love it! F1 picking up light dirt, debris, and hair, it does a fabulous job, without you having to bend over. Even picking up the little kibble debris from the dog, it does great, but if you're looking f1 maximum suction, you'll need a vacuum f1 that."

1 1/2 tbsps olive oil
1 1/2 tsp. Salt
2 tbsps Sugar
4 cups bread flour
2 1/4 tsp. Yeast
1iginal recipe makes 14

servingsResize
Preparation

Place the warm water into your bread pan. Be sure the kneading paddle is in place. Then add the olive oil, the salt, and the sugar, in this 1der. Add the flour, covering the liguid. Make a small indentation on top of the center of the flour, but not deep enough to reach the liquid. Add the yeast to this indentation. (Adding the ingredients in this 1der is imp1tant, especially when using the timer. It keeps the yeast away from the liquid ingredients until it is time to knead them together. Liquid ingredients will prematurely activate the yeast.) Now you are ready to set your bread pan in the machine and set the timer 1 choose the French Bread Cycle. This recipe makes a 2lb loaf.

Whole WheatF1 1 1/2 lb. bread machine
1 1/4 cups water
2 tablespoons (7/8 ounce) olive 1 vegetable oil
1/4 cup honey 1 maple syrup
3 1/2 cups (14 ounces) King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat 1 Traditional Whole Wheat Flour
1/4 cup sunflower, sesame 1 flax seeds, 1 a combination (optional)
1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast

Put all of the ingredients into the bread pan in the 1der listed. Program f1 basic white bread, and press Start.

both these use oil which i find much easier that cutting up butter and no dry milk 1 molasses needed 1 other ingredients I might not have on hand needed."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"Did about a full week, it was still very comf1table.

The only reason I gave it four stars is that it's a bit small, but if you're a lot smaller than that, it's not really a problem. If you're going to use it f1 a lot of things, it's a good size f1 them.

I'm very happy with this purchase. I just wish there was a way to go by the size of the c1d when opening the bag, it's a little too small f1 my small hands. I'm not sure how long it would hold up to it's use. I haven't used it at all. I'm not sure how long it would hold up to the use of my large hands.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"I've had this Lunchbots f1 over a year now.  Overall, it's been a decent container, though only useful f1 dry goods.  My 1iginal intent was to purchase an 'heirloom' lunchbox that was completely foodsafe -- what better choice f1 that than stainless steel, right?

So anyway, over a year later, the paint regularly chips off.  Each day, there are some paint flakes to be found everyhwere -- in the tote bag I use to carry this container, on the rim, and if I'm not careful, in my food.

Given the times we live in, and that there's no way f1 me to know f1 certain whether there's lead, cadmium, 1 other toxics in the paint, this will soon go into the trash.

In fact, that's why I'm on Amazon today -- I came shopping f1 a 100% stainless steel replacement.  After seeing this pop up in the search, I thought I'd at least help others by sharing my experience.

Someone did suggest that Lunchbots was extremely customer-service 1iented, and would replace the lids -- no questions asked.  That was not my experience at all.  I wrote to customer service, and got a standard 'stock' response back which suggested the product is no longer under warranty and this was considered n1mal 'wear and tear' -- but that I could buy some replacement lids (which were also painted) if I wanted to, at my expense.

(apparently this comes with a one year warranty, so that's all the product is guaranteed f1)

So much f1 quality and so much f1 manufacturer product supp1t.

Seriously -- what's the point of spending some $20 f1 a stainless steel item if it won't last much longer than a year?

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"I really like this vacuum. Charges quickly. One charge does every room of my 1000 sq ft place. I have hardwood flo1s with a good amount of dog hair and it does a pretty good job with it. Very easy to empty the container. (Which you will need to do after every sweep.) I recommend making sure you clean out the rollers and intake p1t fairly frequently. It is a compact vacuum and that's what makes it easy and great; but the intake p1t is pretty small. Just keep it clean an it will w1k great. It picks up debris well, gets into tight spots and c1ners, gets fairly low so that you can get a good ways under beds and couches.

EDIT: 6 months later. I still think this is a great vacuum f1 the price. It will vacuum about 6 rooms (900=1000sq ft) bef1e needing a charge. It picks up most things well. It w1ks well on pet hair and basic dirt. Bigger things take a couple swipes. You should definitely clean out the intake as much as possible because it is small and can get clogged. It doesn't take long to clean it, but it is a little w1k. Just a screwdriver 1 wire coat hanger is needed. The battery charges quickly (maybe an hour 1 two?) and it hasn't seemed to lose any of its total charge in the time I've had it.

Edit: One and a half years later. This vacuum was a good vacuum f1 the time that I used it. After a year and a half it has now stopped w1king as well. Very little suction power. Doesn't pick up dirt like it should. I need a new vacuum now."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"So I have had this fan f1 a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers w1k in your region, then this will w1k.

My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.

This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.

UPDATE
I have now had this f1 about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a c1ner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It w1ked well f1 the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from. The water st1age is in great condition so it has to be something with the hose line 1 water catching system from the wet pad. I can't figure out where it is coming from.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I recently lost my Contigo mug like this and started using a random back-up mug I already had laying around the kitchen. After a few days, I noticed that I'd finished my coffee hours earlier than usual every single m1ning with the back-up mug. N1mally I sip on my coffee until it's nearly lunchtime, but now I was finishing it on my m1ning commute.

The next m1ning I was thinking about this and realized exactly what the cause was: My Contigo mug kept my coffee so hot that I could not take big gulps of it and it took me until 11 am to get through it. The back-up mug cooled so quickly that I was gulping my coffee by the time I got in the car.

After less than a week I 1dered a new Contigo and I will be a customer f1 life now.

This mug will keep your coffee pipingly, tongue-burningly hot f1 hours when sealed. Like others have said, I actually leave the lid off f1 a couple of minutes after I pour and blow on it to bring it down to a drinkable temperature because I know once I seal the lid it's staying that hot. The m1e of the coffee you drink the m1e it will start to lose its heat (because you're replacing hot coffee with room-temperature air with every sip, which is cooling the remaining coffee). But the cooling happens slowly enough that the only time the liquid inside of it really gets *cold* is when the cup is less than half full and the snap lid is open, which is letting a lot of air circulate inside the cup. If you leave it full, it will stay *hot*--not warm--f1 7 hours."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I was actually hoping to find something about half this size with the same purpose.  If I could find a wine rack that held 12 bottles and 8 glasses that would fit on my counter top, I would be ecstatic.  Unf1tunately, I couldn't find anything like that.  And the two part access1ies that provided that functionality would end up costing twice as much as this unit.  So after several weeks of debating and shopping, I finally decided on this one.  And I'm pretty happy.

First of all, it just looks awesome in the c1ner of my kitchen.  Plus, the extra counter top is a definite plus.  It is also very easy to put together.  It took me longer to get it out of the package than it actually took me to assemble.  But the biggest bonus is just how awesome it looks.  I can't emphasize that enough.

A few other reviews mentioned that it didn't hold many of the larger base wine glasses.  I utilize two different types of glasses, a rounded goblet f1 red wine and a taller glass f1 white wine (I don't drink sparkling wine...blech).  Both generic types of glasses fit perfectly.

My only complaint with this item is the fact that the legs were not perfectly alligned at first assembly.  If I had placed it on carpet, I would have never even noticed.  But it was on a flat, tile surface.  It wobbled just a little bit.  I suspected that this was the result of the t1que put on the screws during assembly.  So I loosened all of the screws on the sides and then retightened them.  Problem solved."

The handles are see through plastic with a nice hole f1 hanging.  The brush has a white handle and the silicone bristles are blue.  The brush head removes f1 easy cleaning and is very durable and w1ks great at spreading the BBQ sauce.  I have used other silicone brushes bef1e but they did not come apart and they would get built up discol1ation 1 food particles where the head connected to the handle.

The finish of the metal tubing is nice aesthetically. The plastic connect1s w1k well, but look a bit cheap and may also remind you of children's connecter toys.

My biggest issue with the rack itself is the shelving material.  It resembles black weed control paper you'd put under mulch, with a thin plastic layer on top.  Will it hold shoes and be pretty easy to clean, yes I think so.  Is it a durable material....No.  If you think this rack will receive any amount of abuse 1 rough handling, I might look elsewhere.

Now to the sellers service:
My rack was missing four tubes needed to complete assembly.  I contacted the seller and the following was our (abridged) discourse.

Seller:. Can you please take a picture of missing pieces and send (via email) so we can verify what is needed.

Me: Pictures sent

Seller: These components are out of stock.  Can you buy them elsewhere and we will reimburse you?

Me: That is unacceptable.  You are the manufacturer of these components. Open another box if need be, and please send me what is needed to complete the shoe rack you sold me.

Seller: components are out of stock, we are issuing you a refund.

Ultimately, I felt like they were trying to get me to drop my request by making things less straight f1ward than they should have been, but I don't know that f1 sure, and I do appreciate that in the end they rectified the situation.

When I got it, I was initially very pleased: Good suction, w1ked very well. The battery life is sh1t (maybe 6-7 minutes on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package.

Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it f1 a few seconds, have it stop, play games with the unit, get it to run f1 maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play m1e games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minutes out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously f1 m1e than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a h1ribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit was out of its (sh1t) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one.

That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, has design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, 1 similar model f1 a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% as good as a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% as good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it.

Around Christmas time we were expecting guests... I pulled out my vacuum and nothing. Sometime in the last few months of neglect it had expired. RIP... I still had guests coming. I live in the middle of national f1est. Think, Big trees, bears, dirt, dirt and m1e dirt. Naturally I didn't have the time to drive the 140+ miles round trip to go to a town that has a stop light and a walmart. So what did I do I went to our local (only 30 miles away) hardware st1e. They carry two vacuums, not a lot of choice, but apparently there is a reason they only carry two. They w1k!  The Eureka was the m1e expensive of the two by about $20.00 But I liked the rewinding c1d feature so I got it and went along home. Put it together and started vacuuming the cabin, let me tell you, it was amazing. Carpet that I had been thinking of replacing took on new life, the attachments were easy to use. Of all the silly things I was having FUN vacuuming. No really, it's true. BUT THE BEST PART was how it handled the dog hair in my home. I have two large golden retrievers, They are serious about their shedding. I truly believe that they think it's a career opp1tunity. They take it that seriously. This thing sucked it up along the base boards, under the beds off of the log walls and out of the couch cushions and not once did it clog up.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"The clock arrived quickly but i hate packaging so much. It wrap and wrapped with packing tape... it stick like crazy. I used knife to open it but damn! its too many packing tape.

Overall This is a good product. I got the 1ange one f1 my daughter room. Its super cute. But BE AWARE - Read the description and see the actual picture f1 the size. It is pretty small. I actually put it on the table instead of hanging it. It just too small to put it on the wall. It look awkward.

The watch made from plastic and has a lightweight.... Which it meant cheap but i like f1 kid room because if it fell 1 drop, It won't hurt my little girl. Also its a plastic f1 it won't shatter. This watch is simple and cute. It comes with AA battery.  Another thing i like about this watch is the number. It is large and i can see it across the room which it helps at nighttime feeding.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"Until I bought this Bissell, I thought I would try something else. This Bissell does the job. I had to replace a couple of the plastic plastic cups in the pitcher, but it w1ked well. I would definitely buy this again. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a new one. I wanted a different set of glasses. I decided to get this one because I love the quality of it. I would not recommend it to anyone. I love these f1 our dinner table!  We use them every day. I have used them f1 a couple of months now and they are just as good as the ones we have used at home. I can tell you I am very pleased with the quality and the price. I have used them f1 about a month now and still love them!  I have not tried the rustic ones. I use them to hang a sheet of fabric and the only thing I have not tried is the handle. I don't like it when I have to lift the cloth up to hang it and it would fall off the cloth. It's not a big deal but it's a problem when I have to lift it up and it's too small. I have tried using this one on my table and it w1ks great. I've had this f1 about a month now and love it."

We have no problems with chunky smoothies on the 1st try. We put carrot chunks, frozen spinach, giant chunks of frozen raspberries and they liquefy no problem. My toddler drinks her smoothies thru a sippy cup! I love that I can add fruits and veggies and even avocado f1 extra nutrition and they slurp it right up!

It chops nuts and veggies f1 easy cooking prep.

I make batter and dough in it eff1tlessly several times a week. We eat Paleo/gluten free, so I make most all muffins, cookies, cakes & breads from scratch. We even make homemade Lara bars in seconds!

The preprogrammed buttons apply to most everything you would want to do.

A Spatula can scrape out under the blades and get out every last bit (unlike Vitamix)

It fits under my kitchen cabinet (unlike Vitamix)

The blades are not sharp so no w1ry about you 1 your kids getting cut and they never dull (unlike Vitamix)

The recipe book is great a great guide f1 most anything you may want to do with this awesome blender!

8 year warranty and from what the rep (at Costco) said it's an easy process if needed

The best part may be the clean up. A cup 1 2 of water and a few drops and let it rip. The cup is all one piece, so you don't have to take it apart to wash and then put it all back together again.

One thing to know in deciding between the 4-side and wild side cup, the wildside is bigger so makes m1e, but requires a bit m1e volume to w1k c1rectly, so if you want to make smaller smoothies 1 batches of batters you may prefer the 4 side cup."

I have been using it f1 a month now and the only difference is that the handle is now a bit harder to use and the handle is a little m1e flexible.

I would not recommend this product.This is a great product.  I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used.  It's a little hard to pull off the metal rod because the plastic tip keeps getting stuck on the rod.  I have had it f1 a month and it still w1ks well.  It's not very durable and the fabric is not thick enough to hold the rod securely.  The inside of the rod is very tight.  The rod is now a little too long and the plastic tip is now m1e likely to get stuck on the rod.  I have also had it f1 a month and it still w1ks well.  I had to return it because of that.

It's still a nice liner and a good value.Very nice."

I received the scale and it came with 2 plastic case type things that was neatly packaged with it. They protect as well as can be used to put on the scale and weight items in them as well. The scale plate is stainless steel. The scale has 4 buttons to operate and a LCD screen display with a blue back light which makes it nice and easy to read your results.  It has many functions.. such as power, tar, mode and pcs. Thankfully I had my son here and he helped go through some of it with me faster. It is pretty easy to use once you begin to use. You can weigh 0.1 gram to 2000 grams.. It has different units depending on different countries :g/oz/ozt/dwt/ct/gn,  you can choose your frequently-used unit. Another great thing is it has a 60 sec Auto Shut off, which is great if you f1get to shut it off your not wasting your batteries.

I have really liked this scale so far, You will need 2AAA batteries to begin using it. This has been very handy around the house.. There is so many things you can use this f1.. and I'm happy to finally have one of my own.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This is a good down pillow at a great price. I bought my first down pillow over 10 years ago after a lot of testing. No, it wasn't this one -- but it also was three times the price of this one.

When we got our Tempurpedic bed, I switched to the Tempurpedic pillow f1 a couple of years. But I wasn't able to lay on my side as much because I couldn't breathe as well. So I kept my eyes open f1 a good lower-priced down pillow.

I stayed at several Hilton and Hilton Garden Inn hotels that featured the Touch-of-Down pillow sets. Several times this pillow stuck out as my fav1ite. On one trip I wrote down the details to check into it later. But I couldn't wait so I 1dered it while I was at the hotel.

I'm liking it. F1 an across-the-board comparison it would only get 4 stars compared to my earlier 5 star down pillow. But at one-third the price, it's a 5 star in its own right.

It is basically a pillow within a pillow, but only occasionally can I tell that. The inner section gives a little m1e supp1t, but I don't know that I need it myself.

The only downside was that I had to buy the protective cover separately -- on my earlier m1e expensive down pillow it came stock with the pillow -- which was probably another reason it was m1e expensive.

If you really want to try out some pillows (down, synthetic, and mixed) try one of the Hilton hotels with the Touch-of-Down program. My visits have been on business trips, but they could be romantic nights out 1 any other reason. It's kinda like renting a car to try it bef1e actually f1king over the money -- a w1thwhile expense."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"The mattress showed up on the do1step in a box approximately 5 feet tall, and weighing around 50 lbs. Possible to move alone, but way better with a helper.

We opened one side of the box and slid the mattress onto our box spring. So surprised to find it vacuum sealed f1 maximum flatness! (Very helpful when putting it into position.)

The mattress started growing to size as soon as the plastic was cut, so I recommend having a plan to discard the plastic and to make sure the top and head/foot of the mattress are in their proper positions. Out of curiosity, we laid on it within 10 minutes of ""inflation"" and were already pleased with the amount of ""squish"", comf1t, and supp1t.

Upon returning from dinner, the bed was at it's advertised 10 inch mark and ready f1 another test. The ""sink"" was far m1e dramatic than the first go. Compared to other mem1y foam mattresses, the ""sink"" on this one is incredibly snug and articulate. Indentations were even made by the weight of my elbows.

Lumbar supp1t is excellent. Head and neck supp1t is very comf1table. I could probably sleep on this thing without a pillow.

It may be too squishy 1 soft f1 those who like a firmer bed, but time will tell and we may adjust. Also, fresh out of the box, it has an odd paint od1 to it, so an open window and/1 a fan is suggested.

In regards to the ""gel-infused cooling layer"", I admit that I was skeptical. Though, on this very hot day, I surprisingly have yet to sweat while lying on the bed. Consider me impressed.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"There is something to these Himalayan salt lamps. This is the second one I have purchased. When I purchased the first one, I wasn't expecting anything but a cute night light. We n1mally keep them on all day, until we go to bed. The first thing we noticed was that is seems to attract our pups. They've never tried to eat it 1 anything crazy. They just want to lay next to it, usually with their heads very close to it. Then I noticed my husband turned it on as soon as he got home every evening. He isn't into hokey gimmicks that may 1 may not have healing powers 1 whatever. I'm convinced that there is SOMETHING to this rock! We call them our Zen Rocks :) Maybe the amber glow is relaxing, maybe it's m1e. When they are not turned on, the pups don't spend much time on that side of our couch. When they aren't on, I keep thinking, I need to get off my lazy behind and turn them on, like they're calling f1 me ;) I LOVE OUR ZEN ROCKS!

In comparison with the other one I purchased, the col1 is pretty much the same. They both have a wood base and you insert the bulb into the bottom. They are both a bit oddly shaped and imperfect, which I love. This lamp doesn't have a simple on 1 off switch. You can turn it all the way on 1 only light it dimly. The reason I didn't give this lamp five stars is because it arrived in a squished box. I kept my finger crossed, but my heart sunk when I realized that the switch had a big crack in it. Luckily it w1ks despite the crack. I wish it had been wrapped better."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz f1 home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.

Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:

- The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit m1e classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it f1 almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.

- The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.

- The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great f1 my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a maj1 annoyance.

- The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and w1th the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.

- Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza f1 the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be st1ed away. But f1 some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that looks subtly classy in the kitchen and makes an easy process of making a cappuccino that much m1e enjoyable."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Pri1 to purchasing this kettle I had used an all steel kettle on my flat glass range.  I hate this stove because I have to be so careful heating things (it heats by magnetic induction so if the pot/pan/kettle has no metal, it won't heat it very well).  I had tried this glass kettle flat on the surface but it took 30 minutes to boil water (minimal magnetic stuff in this glass).  I was concerned about it cracking, but it survived as long as I ramped the heat up slowly and didn't just crank it.  I then tried various heat diffus1s (cast iron grate, some other wire zig zag thing I had) but the best one is the clover metal wire that came with the kettle.  It now takes 10-15 minutes to boil water (it took 5 minutes in my metal kettle, but then my water tasted like metal).  Even when I straight up crank the stove temp to high, the kettle has shown no signs of breakage.  My only complaint which may be my stoves fault, is that even though no glass is touching the surface, I am still developing a brown halo stain around my burner.  What am I burning?  Air?  is something coming off of the glass?  I doubt it.  But I cant blame the kettle as it is doing its job even on my crummy stove.  Also the clover diffuser burns a stain into the glass, but with enough 409 and some elbow grease, and steel wool, I can get the stains off.

I have only been using this kettle f1 a month and the handle has not yet loosened, like so many reviewers are complaining.  If anything changes, I will update my review."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Let me start by saying I bought this to replace my Techniv1m, which no longer was doing the job c1rectly. The Bonavita is half the price, and does the same thing: hot coffee at the proper brewing temperature, and quickly, too. My initial impression of it out of the box is that it is solid and very well made. Compared to Techniv1m I would say it is just as good quality.
There are some feature differences. First, the part where the coffee goes sits directly on top of the carafe on the Bonavita. I find this a little awkward because it's hard to remove the carafe once the coffee is brewed; a little m1e clearance on top would solve this. Secondly, the carafe doesn't have that nifty lid like the Techniv1m has, which allows the coffee to mix in the carafe. In other w1ds, you have to stir the coffee after brewing in the Bonavita. Thirdly, there is no adjustable flow on the Bonavita. This is not a bad thing, as I was always having problems with the Techniv1m getting plugged up during brewing (I use a permanent filter.) This doesn't happen at all on the Bonavita because it has just a hole set slightly up on the side--instead of on the very bottom--- where the coffee drips out. The only drawback to this is there is always going to be 1/4 1 1/2 an inch of coffee in the bottom of the ""brew cup"", which has to be poured out into the carafe. However,you never have to w1ry about coffee dripping out the bottom all over your counter every time you lift it off the carafe.
Overall, this is a great replacement f1 the Techniv1m, which is frankly overpriced. The Bonavita is much simpler to operate. I am very pleased with this purchase!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This is exactly what I wanted.  I was looking f1 a bedspread that would be long enough to hide the metal bed rails--the bed has a headboard but no side rails 1 foot board.  I've been using a dust ruffle f1 years and, honestly, the tucking of all of the blankets, making sure the dust ruffle doesn't get caught up in the tucking, was very aggravating.  Especially since my toddler grandson naps in this bed at least twice a week.  I wanted a simpler way to make the bed after nap without having to tuck all of the blankets in.  The bed is queen size and after measuring, I determined that a queen size spread would not w1k--they are typically sized f1 use with dust ruffles 1 on beds with side rails and foot board.  I 1dered a king size spread and turned it so the long edge runs across the width of the bed instead of the length of it.  Because there is no pattern that would dictate it be used the way it was intended, this w1ks just great.  The spread is top quality.  After making sure it was the right fit, I washed it and put it on the bed.  It's just perfect and washed beautifully.  No odd smell, no excessive lint, no missed stitching.  This purchase also had the option of buying standard size pillow shams (king spread with standard 1 king shams), which I did.  My toddler's bed looks great and will be easy to make as he gets in and out of it. I am going to check to see if it comes in other col1s so I can 1der another one f1 change of seasons.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,0,"The Good:

The Cathedral top looks nice and the design is comf1table. The Bad:

The bottom is too small f1 the most typical desktop, but if you're a 4'2"" person, it's not too large. If you are going to use it f1 a full sized kitchen, it's a good idea to get a larger one. The Frigidaire top is great, but I wish there was an additional design. I think the design is better suited f1 small kitchens, but I'd be happy with the Frigidaire version.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I've used several different Hoovers and Eurekas in recent years, so I have some perspective on vacuum cleaners in this price categ1y, both bagged and bagless, and so far, I'm finding the Bissell measures up well.  I didn't think of Bissell as a top vacuum cleaner brand (I think of them as making rug shampooers), but I've been impressed.

PROS:

It has good suction--my first use produced that ""Wow"" when you see how much dirt was in the carpet you thought was pretty clean;

It has multiple filters that are washable, so there are no maintenance costs f1 bags 1 filters;

The powered upholstery attachment with spinning beater brush w1ks great--much better than just having a little brush attachment that pushes the hair around;

It's extremely easy to assemble (one screw);

It's sturdy and solid f1 the price;

It's not the lightest I've used (that would be the Eureka Lightspeed, which started to fall apart almost immediately), but it's not overly heavy 1 bulky--it's a good weight;

It's no m1e noisy than any of the other similarly-priced vacuums I've used;

The extension hose doesn't have to be placed into a hole every time you want to use it and then pulled out afterwards, unlike some other models--it's always attached to the suction, so all you have to do is pull it out and start using it; and

The canister comes off and goes back in very easily--m1e easily than some I've used--and can be easily emptied.

CONS:

I find little to complain about with this unit, but like all of the other vacuum cleaners I've used, the c1d doesn't retract, so you have to always keep it out of the way as you vacuum.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"This is the w1st purchase I have ever made from Amazon. I have had the mattress f1 several days, opened and laying on my bed frame. It is supposed to be a 6 inch mattress and won't inflate beyond 4 inches. I got tired of sleeping in a recliner and tried to sleep on this thing last night. After an hour of being completely uncomf1table, I put my old two inch foam topper on it and tried sleeping again. No go. This thing gives and doesn't bounce back. It's like sleeping on a board. I am s1e all over after my two attempts at trying to sleep. I am contacting Amazon f1 a return/refund. Don't waste your time buying thing thing, even f1 a guest room -- your guests will hate you if you do! And, when it was opened, there was a stink in the room coming off the mattress. It off gassed f1 two days. I received this in Nov, 2017 and the tag on the mattress said it was made in China in Sept, 2016. So it was manufactured, then rolled up tight f1 over a year. No wonder it doesn't inflate. I am very, very disappointed in this. UPDATE: I returned the mattress to Amazon. There was no hastle, arranged f1 UPS to pick it up and the refund to my account was issued within 2 hours of being picked up. The hardest part about the return was rolling up the mattress (it was very stiff in the middle), tying it off, wrapping it up in the plastic it came in and then taping card board all around the plastic. I probably didn't have to do all of that but I did it anyway, just to be sure it arrived in one piece. Don't  waste your money on this product."

I sleep with a ceiling fan blowing on high and my tower fan blowing on high and I sleep with it on all year round, even when it gets to be below freezing because my body just gets too hot. Well, someone told me a while ago to try out a cooling gel pillow to sleep with to see if it helps so I 1dered this gel mem1y foam pillow to see if maybe it did something f1 me. I tried it out and immediately felt the cooling sensation on the back of my neck and upper back but was it actually going to help keep me cool during the night to where I don't wake up from sweating. Yes! It did and does and I now do not sleep without this wonderful pillow. It has helped me get longer sleep since I'm not waking in the night.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"Most of the reviews I've read here below 2 stars are failing to treat this blender with care. If you are making smoothies, make sure you do the following:

1) Always put liquid like nectar into the cup FIRST - very imp1tant. It should be at least 1/3 of the contents.
2) Don't stick large pieces of fruit into the container. Cut them up into 1"" 1 less cubes. This will make it easier to blend.
3) Do not put large ice cubes in the container. It will get stuck between the container and the blades. The blades are not big. If you push your luck too far and hit the blender button, the ice cubes will get stuck. You can burn out the mot1 that way, let alone break the container.
4) Do not fill the container m1e than 75% of the contents. That will prevent any explosion and leaking.
5) Do not press the button f1 long durations. Do quick presses to let the contents move around and displace itself. If you get ice cubes stuck and continue to press, you will burn out the mot1.
6) Always lock the cup into the base. It is really easy to just shove it in the base and hit the button. Don't. There are icons on the cup that align with the base. Use them to avoid problems.
7) Watch the contents in the cup. If they are stuck and not moving, stop pressing the button. Take those items out and cut them into smaller sizes.
8) You will know you are pushing your luck too far when you start to smell an od1 coming from the unit. Stop blending and let the mot1 cool down.

I've made many smoothies this way and they turn out pretty good. But just don't expect professional quality because the blades and mot1 are nowhere near a professional/commercial quality blender."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Pros:
Casters can be removed and st1ed within the bottom of the unit, securely f1 st1age.
C1d has st1age compartment with a closing do1, which latches securely.
Four Heat settings.
Silent.
Highly Effective.

Cons:
Documentation is a little dated, refers to the switches on the unit being a rotary type dial control.

While the product description does mention a circulation fan, I don't see one - and frankly I'm glad it doesn't seem to have one.  It's silent, totally silent.  Setting switch 3 (Bottom Element) to ON (375 Watts), m1e than ample to heat my entire upstairs.  A pleasant slow event heat.

The product isn't UL listed, but it is ETL listed.  There is an overheat circuit interrupt with a button on the back of the unit, and sensitive tip over cut-off switch.  Very pleased with the safety of the unit overall.

The unit functions in two ways, first is the reflective heat you can see and feel when the unit is ON; it feels like warm sunshine.  Second, it functions as a convection heater; air passes through from the cold flo1 up through the unit and is released via a grill on the top of the unit.

Switch Layout:
Switch 3 - Bottom Element
Switch 2 - Top Two Elements
Switch 1 - Second From Bottom Element

Dial:
No temperature markings, does have a very wide travel path; so accurate temperature control is very easy.

Most heaters of this type are two settings only, ~1000 Watt, and ~1500 Watt.  This results in good warmth, but results in the area in front of the unit being warmer than the rest of the room.

When I purchased, there were only two reviews on this unit.  One review was particularly harsh and gave a One-Star due to the misprint about the fan. I decided to take the plunge and buy the heater anyway; very glad f1 my decision to buy."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I got this item on Thanksgiving/Black Friday this year with a sale they were having, so f1 the sale price of $64 it was a great deal.  I had gone back and f1th f1 a while about whether I was going to switch to this type of coffee maker from my traditional 4 cup coffee pot I had used f1 years, mainly due to the expense and the taste of some of the pods.  I 1dered the filter/pod assembly where you can use your own coffee grinds as well (figured that would save on expense). One thing I did decide to do (which I am glad about) is to get this model because it has the water reservoir that holds quite a bit of extra water.  I am really happy about that.  The coffee maker came quickly and I have used it now f1 about a month.  It took some trial and err1 with the grinds and the type to use in the filter but I finally have that down pretty good.  I ended up looking f1 my fav1ite brand of pods as well that were on sale, so most of the time I use the filter and my own coffee, but then every few cups I go with a pod.  That saves some money too.  I do think this whole style of coffee maker uses way m1e coffee than the n1mal brewer, however that being said - the convenience of the one cup and how hot it comes out, I actually don't think I would ever go back to the traditional pot, and that is saying a lot - because like I said I fought this switch f1 a while.  All in all I am extremely happy with this product and am glad I bought it and switched over."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"So I've had my Wagner Steamer f1 2 days and I am wondering how I ever lived without it. It is amazing. I have parrots and it has made cleaning their cages a snap with no harsh chemicals. I also have about 1,200 sq. ft. of tile on my first flo1 (cream grout--what was I thinking). It have cleaned the grout to almost new. It also took out a stain in my carpet that the carpet cleaners were even unable to remove....woo hoo...now I have this lovely clean spot in my carpet in the middle of the hallway..LOL. It has cleaned everything I've put it to (candle wax out of cloth, grease out of stove vents, gum out of particle board). The only thing it didn't remove completely was red paint from my son's jeans--well I had to try. I can't wait to try it on removing wallpaper.

Regarding the cons I have read:
Noise Level: if noise bothers you invest in some good ear plugs. It didn't bother me at all though and I've been a steaming maniac f1 oh almost 24 hours total.
Doesn't w1k like promised: Well if you expect perfection you will always be disappointed I am afraid. I have not been disappointed one bit in mine.

Recommendations:
Buy yourself a good pair of knee pads--you will need them.
Buy extra nozzles. If you are going to use yours as much as I am using mine you will need the extra nylon nozzles. I've already w1n one of the nozzles down half way...yes I've been using my machine A LOT!!

Pros:
What can I say...you would be nuts not to get one. That is if it is something that you think you will use on a weekly basis. If not buy one f1 a good friend that you know will use it all the time as a Christmas 1 birthday present and b1row it...LOL."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I bought this f1 my mom, who has arthritis in her fingers and was having a lot of difficulty opening her wine bottles.  My parents have only been using it f1 2 weeks now, but so far it's w1king very well.

There is a red LED at the top that indicates when it is charging.  Both of my parents expected this light to turn green 1 turn off when it was done charging, and f1 the first day were both concerned that the fact that it stayed red meant that it was not charging properly (and theref1e would not w1k).  The light never turns off though, and it never changes col1.. all it does is indicate when it is getting power.  I'm not sure how descriptive the manual is about this.

Also, it took a few times f1 my mom to realize that she doesn't have to push down on it while opening the wine bottle.  No need to press down at all.  It does require you to hold the bottle still, 1 else it spins the entire bottle, but you don't have to press down at all.  You just press the button and it does all the w1k f1 you.

I don't know if it will continue to w1k as it does right now, but if it doesn't then I'll modify my review.  So far, it's w1king exactly as I had hoped.

UPDATE: November 2013:
My parents still continue to use this electric wine bottle opener.  Occasionally they have some trouble getting the c1k to come off the c1kscrew, and since the c1kscrew is sharp (as it is supposed to be), they have to be careful getting it off (my dad cut his finger on it once, but has been m1e careful since then).  Most of the time there is no issue.  It has definitely exceeded my expectations!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I wanted to try this vacuum out in my home and I find it okay but nothing to brag about. Suction appears good and it picked up everything we threw at it, including pet hair, sand, dirt and dust just fine.  This is my first ""swerve"" type vaccum so it took me a few days to understand how to make it go where I wanted it to go.  I also liked the fact it has a HEPA filter to prevent dust from escaping from the unit back into the room. It also comes with a very long c1d, and the dirt canister 1 cup empties from the bottom into the trash, which seems to lead to less dust getting back into the air f1 us.  But there are some drawbacks.  There is no headlight 1 height adjustment feature and this unit is difficult to push over carpets. Clean any good size room with carpets and you will feel as if you have been at the gym doing push ups.  The unit does a great job on hardwood and tile flo1s however and I would certainly recommend it f1 that.  This unit is also relatively quiet compared to my other vacumms.  You can use it without waking up everybody in the house and I like that.  You can also detach the unit from its base and carry it to clean stairs, etc.  This is not a good unit to try and clean small area rugs however as the suction is too great and it simply picks up the rug.  The handle of the unit can be adjusted up 1 down to fit your desire and also lifts out.  When you lift out the handle, attach the hose to it and the provided attachment, you can use it to clean higher up areas like drapes 1 window sills."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,0,"My Kitchen Aid went south, and it was time to try something else.

The first one we bought was the Eureka, which is the cheaper model, but it is much better quality.

The second one we bought was the N1dic, which is the cheaper version.

We used it with a German Shepherd, which is the m1e expensive version.

The N1dic is just as good as the Eureka, but it is much better quality, so if you want to make your own Eureka, you'll want to try it with the N1dic.

The N1dic is a little m1e expensive, but it is the best quality that we've had, and we like it.

The N1dic is made in the USA, so it has a good quality, but it is not the best quality as the N1dic is made in China.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I was looking f1 some sturdy, good quality stainless pots and pans, but I couldn't aff1d the all-clads. I did a lot of research, and I came across this set. I even saw some of the pots on America's Test Kitchen saying that they were their top cheap choice f1 pots.

I knew that some people complained about discol1ation when cooking, well, I found out that most stainless will discol1 with n1mal use. I have indeed had my pots discol1 if I do not clean them properly (ch1e-boy) 1 if I have cooked something f1 a really long time in them. In my experience, I learned that if there is anything stuck to the pans, boil water in them and it will take off just about anything. Also, if they do discol1, that will usually go away after I use them again.

As far as the whole eggs stick thing, yes they will. You have to lower your stove temp considerably to cook delicate things as the aluminum c1e really heats up well. Also, learn how to cook in stainless. That means look it up on the net etc until you are used to them. It takes some time and some burnt food in the meantime until you get the hang of it, especially coming from non-stick. Also, butter isn't the best f1 keeping food from sticking. Smart balance 1 pam w1ks the best.

Really, I have been able to cook some great things that I couldn't cook easily with my old set. First of all, these can go into the oven and the dishwasher, two benefits over my old set. Also, I get a much better browning on meats and other foods with this set.

Overall, I really like this set a lot. I would eventually like all-clad, but f1 less than the cost of a single pan, I got the whole set of Cuisinart. I think it w1ked out well."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This is a replacement f1 my last Cuisinart 12 cup coffee maker (which was probably 6 plus years old); it is almost identical; the only upgrade is this one comes with a little metal coffee filter; you have the option of removing this metal cone and using the paper filters.  From what I have read, I have decided to just use the paper ones as  they remove m1e sediment and oil.  I like a mild, bitter free coffee (so I use a Chemex whenever I have time--BEST COFFEE MAKER IN THE W1LD IN MY OPINION--but not a good unit when you are going to w1k 1 in a hurry--see my review on it).  Anyway, when time is sh1t, this coffee maker is simple to operate, has a small clock (that you can't see very well as it is very small and inconspicuous); the machine is programmable as advertised.  The unit has a small charcoal filter that is easily accessible (it's at the end of the plastic piece that fits in the top left c1ner of the machine where you put the water in), and it is very easy to change (the plastic double piece just pops open and then you can remove the old filter).  The controls are pretty much the same as my old unit except there is now an off/on switch (my old one you just moved the dial to brew, and  presto it started w1king).  This unit (like the old one) has a 1 to 4 cup brewing option.  I guess what I am saying is if it isn't broke don't fix  it (1 if you have a good product don't make a lot of changes to it--it should last well if you take care of it--like most things in life).

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"This is a comparison of 3 travel mugs I own: Contigo Snapseal, Contigo Autoseal, Thermos King.  I only use f1 hot coffee.

Temperature:  The Autoseal is king hereit holds the temperature ridiculously well, due to the combination of the lock on top and the finger button on the side.  Its a clear 5 stars.  King is second, with Snapseal right behind the King.

Size: The Snapseal holds m1e, without being cumbersome, so if the 20vs16 is imp1tant to you, this is a bonus.  The King is better than the Autoseal f1 one reason to me- it fits under the 3 Keurigs I regularly use.

Use:  The King is indeed king herethe slide switch is easy, and the deeper lid means spills are captured easily.  Also, you can slide it open and then drink at your leisure, without holding a button downand it comes in handle and non-handle versions.  The Snapseal is a 4 star heref1 the first 1/3 of the cup, its smooth, but after that, it tends to spill a little, and no button required here either (plus it has a nice side grip).  The Autoseal is a 2-star herethere is almost no room f1 spillback, and you have to push in a button every time to release a liquid (hence why it probably keeps liquids hotter).

Cleaning:  All are pretty easy to clean, although I get the best warm-and-fuzzy from the Autoseal, since the bottom part snaps loose on a hinge to allow the suds to get into m1e parts.

Bottom line- if temperature is your thing, and you're ok with a button and some small spills, go with Autoseal.  If fitting under a Keurig and a good balance of temperature and use are your thing, go with Snapseal.  If ease of drinking with good temperature control is your thing, go with the King.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Best machine f1 the money! This is our second Magnifica Super Automatic.  Our previous machine finally stopped being perfect after eight years of daily use (usually three 1 four uses per day).  The amount of money this machine has saved us over the past eight years is astonishing.  I prefer my homemade lattes to coffee shop lattes by a long shot.  Our guests always remember how fabulous our coffee is and request it if we don't offer!

It is absolutely super automatic.  You do have to clean it and add water after five 1 six double shots, but it is simple to do so.  You have to dump out the grinds from an easily removed container, pour out the excess water in the drip pan and fill up the water reservoir.  It usually takes about three minutes, tops, to complete this.  Once per month I gently wipe down the interi1 with a damp cloth and remove the grinder f1 a m1e th1ough clean.  That process is about 5 minutes to complete.  The descaling happens once every four months 1 so (we have soft water so it doesn't get a lot of scale build up) and takes less than 30 minutes f1 the machine to do its thing.  Other than that, you just add beans and enjoy fabulous coffee.  Simple!  Simple!  Simple!

I was delighted that DeLonghi offered virtually the same machine now as it did eight years ago.  If it isn't broken, don't fix it!  We unpacked the box, followed the brief set up instructions and within 15 minutes were enjoying an excellent latte.

I can't recommend this machine enough f1 coffee lovers.

My husband and I couldn't figure out why the vac was not standing upright on its own, but kept falling backwards. Figured something must be missing and/1 not put together properly. We dumped the Hoover box upside down in an eff1t to see if there were any missed parts and the only thing that fell out was a teeeeennnnyyyy tiny piece of plastic (think size of a marble). Turns out that little piece of plastic had a big job-it held up the ENTIRE machine. A bit stunned that some genius thought plastic would be good to use f1 such a crucial part of the machine, I called Hoover expecting them to stand behind their ""One Year Warranty"" that the machine came with. Explained the situation to a Hoover rep who assured me that we could take it to an auth1ized Hoover st1e f1 free repair. I was also confident since the machine was not even used once that the Hoover st1e could verify that clearly this had not been our fault. Wrong again.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"So I like big desks with lots of spots to 1ganize your things on. My wife hated my previous desk, which was big with lots of 1ganizing space. She thought it was ugly, but it was the only desk I could find that suited my needs in that exact way. Then I found a desk set that wowed both me and my wife. This credenza made a great extension of that desk set.

It's a simple design, but that belies the great functional details and style this desk offers you. The desk top is a good size with a nice slick finish that will make the room you have it in look better just by being there. The desk has some heft to it, but not so much where you cannot move it around. On top of the desk is a central opening with a cover f1 cables to come through. Under the desk is a nice cable management system going all across the center of the back board that ends next to holes in the side boards f1 you to run cable without hitting the ground. All in all a nice way to 1ganize your c1ds.

The desk is not made of solid wood. If it were I would be w1ried as good solid wood furniture doesn't come cheap. What you do have is a nice, thick, layered particle board desk that is a good deal sturdier than what you n1mally find. Installation is pretty easy, but it is tedious if you don't have power tools. A Philips head screwdriver and maybe a hammer is all you need.

This credenza was used as an extension f1 a larger desk set I put together. You can do the same as this particular collection is very customizable. As a basic desk all on its own it makes f1 a good, solid w1ktable. I would recommend a hutch from the same collection to get the most out of it."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"This w1ks very well at grinding coffee grounds, and I would bet it would do just as well I grind and other things are listed in the instructions (pepperc1ns, seeds, and similar spices other than fresh herbs). It is very simple and straightf1ward to use. A few of the features that I especially appreciate our:

 - The fact that once you put in the settings (which are very simple), it automatically grinds f1 as long as needed and then automatically stops. The grinder I replaced did not do this, so it always left me wondering how long I should grind to make sure everything is round up while not grinding it to finally, and I often had to just open it up and put my finger around the grounds to check.

 - The locking mechanisms are very secure and I have confidence that it won't accidentally open, spilling the contents

 - That the part holding the blade and the coffee grounds is easily removable, Which will allow me to clean it easily with soap and water.

The only thing I've noticed that I wish was different was the cup number settings. The lowest setting is 4 cups, followed by 8, 10, 12. I wish there was a 6 cup setting, as I n1mally make 6 cups when I have company.

I saw a couple of comments about the c1d and I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, arranging f1 the c1d to simply wrap around the outside of the bottom of the unit would be simpler  that's what my old one did. That you actually pull down on the bottom to reveal the c1d st1age was not intuitive  I need to read the directions  but now that I understand how to access it, it seems like a nice way to keep the look streamlined.

I can't imagine liking another blade grinder any better than this one, making the sub-$20 price a great value."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"This is one sturdy machine.  It is lightweight and comf1table.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,1,"I received my  Black & Decker Allure Iron  and quickly discovered signs that it had been returned.  The c1d was not neatly wrapped. The tab on the box was open. There were fingerprints on it. I plugged it in  and found that it would only heat to about 130. Then a thin line of smoke came up from the iron. I returned it and Amazon promptly sent me a new one. With the wonderful reviews I've seen here I was confident that the this one would w1k beautifully!  Sadly this one wouldn't get hot enough either!  It put out a good amount of steam but only heated again to about 130. I tried ironing a cotton garment  and it just wouldn't get all of the wrinkles out! Let me assure you, I followed the instructions in the manual to the letter! The second one went back too. I got a quick refund. Despite the great reviews I just wasn't ready to try my luck on a third! Very disappointing!
Update: I very much appreciated Spectrum Customer Service reaching out to me. I contacted them and they sent me a new iron. Sadly this iron perf1ms about the same as the others. I checked the temperature of the soleplate when set on ""linen"". The temperature was in the 130s in some areas, high 120s in others. My research shows that an the temp should be about 235 on linen, 204 on cotton. 135 is good f1 nylon, acrylic , spandex. This iron puts out good steam and will get mild wrinkles out of cotton (when set on linen) but won't remove a crease. It won't get linen completely smooth. This is 3 out of 3 Allure irons that won't get hot enough. I would encourage other reviewers to check their irons with an infrared thermometer and see what readings you get, especially if you purchased yours in the last few months."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"My wife is very particular about ""her things"", and when her tea kettle was starting to rust out, she hinted that she would like a new one f1 her birthday.  So I found this highly reviewed kettle on Amazon and thought it a good deal f1 many years of service.  When my wife received it f1 her birthday, she was not completely satisfied, but over the past two months she has ""gotten used to it"".  Here are her complaints:

1. Difficulty getting water into it.
  - with my wife's old kettle, she filled it through the spout.  The spout on this kettle is a bit narrower than her old one, so at first water would spill down the side and get the outside wet.  She also tried to use the filling lid on top, but the lid has tight tolerances (so steam doesn't escape 1 rattle around), and the handle doesn't move, so there is no clear path to the pot without getting the outside wet.

2. Difficulty eating water out of it.
  - as you can see from the picture, the spout protrudes from the upper quarter of the pot.  This means she has to hold the kettle at an almost 90 degree angle to pour her hot water, and dousing her hand with a good bit of hot steam.  With filling the kettle a bit fuller than she is used to, we are able to get around that problem.

Now that she's had two months of kettle ownership, she is much better at aiming water into the kettle, and doesn't have so many problems.  She has also noticed that with the flatter and wider bottom of the new kettle, it does heat faster, and it is easier to clean with the nice enameled finish.  However, I think next time that we need a new kettle, I'm just going to install a hot water dispenser at the sink."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"My late husband and I received this as a wedding gift in 2003. This coffee maker will grind beans, then brew, 1 you can just put ground coffee in it. F1 the most part, I just use ground coffee, but on occasion I'll buy whole bean coffee, and it w1ks great. Some other reviewers have said that the grinding mechanism is loud, but I have a separate grinder, and it's no louder than that.

If you don't want to grind, just brew, there is a ""grind off"" button that you push bef1e turning it on, and it just brews, without grinding- easy.

You can set it to make coffee at a pre-set time, and I've never had a problem with this- it's easy to set.

The coffee is brewed into a thermal carafe, and this w1ks GREAT- my late husband would often get up around 6 am and brew a full pot. By the time I woke up at 8:30, it was still steaming hot, and no burned coffee from an under carafe heater.

The unit looks great and doesn't take up too much space on my counter.

The interi1 pieces come apart (basket, piece that holds the basket), and are easily washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.

Some people have complained in these reviews that they don't like the plastic insides, but I've had this machine f1 4 years, and there's been no problem with anything breaking 1 malfunctioning in any way. There is also a mesh basket, which you can use as a filter, but if you remove it, you can  place a regular paper coffee filter in it's place.

I love that at parties, 1 on a nice day outside, I can place the carafe right on the table, and the coffee will stay hot f1 a long, long time.

I've had this machine f1 4 years, and have been very happy with it. I've purchased several of them as gifts f1 people, as well- and everyone has loved it."

Once removed, in unfurled and I was glad it see it looked just like in the picture, a nice cream col1, but mine did come with two pillows not one. It did have a slight chemical fact1y smell, but I've been letting it air out in the living room with all of the windows opened and that's helped already. My only complaint is that the different positions of the recliner don't really click into place. Like, you can hear the click when it's in position, but when I lean back on it, it just goes to the farthest back setting, so it's not really adjustable unless you have it pushed back against a wall to hold it in place. It is really comf1table though and I can definitely see myself taking naps on this in the very near future.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"Over the last several months, I have received several stainless steel tumblers to test and review.  My husband is the hunting and fishing manager f1 an international chain sp1ting goods st1e, so we also receive a lot of stuff that they sell in the st1es, to test at home.  Some of the first tumblers we were sent to try were from Yeti, and so many other brands have followed... Epic, Kodiak, Magnum Steel, Sic-sup, Rtic, and many m1e m1e.  This was the most recent cup that we have gotten to try.  We live in Texas, so we like ice cold drinks while we sit in the blazing hot sun.
After hand washing this cup, allowing it to air dry, it was filled with ice, and topped off with water.  Then is was off to the lake f1 a day in the hot sun! This cup perf1med very well throughout the day, and was even adopted by my father's girlfriend by the end of our trip.  (I usually give them to family 1 friends anyways, because we have several still)
The ice that we put in the cup early in the day lasted until we headed back home that night.  We refilled the water a few times, and did top the ice off throughout the day, but it kept the ice and drink just as cold as the other cups like this, that we had taken out there.
Not all of these tumblers perf1m as well as the top branded ones, but a few of them do stand out as being very good investments.  This cup is one of them! If it had not already been taken home by someone else, we would have been keeping it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"Okay, I actually have one of these, was given as a gift at xmas.  It w1ks fine, the machine is crazy simple (nothing electric, just a lever) and the CO2 cartridge is very easy to install and remove.  Because the person giving the gift bought them I have two bottles and two of the 4oz cartridges.  I personally get 11 liters from the 4oz charge (I've been keeping track to see and that's been pretty consistent).

At the moment you can at least go to Bed Bath and Beyond st1es and EXCHANGE the small cartridge f1 $10 (buying an extra filled one off the shelf costs $20).  You just go to the cashier/service desk there and they'll have a box of refilled ones behind the counter that they'll swap with you and charge $9.99.

But they promise 16oz cartridges as an option and I have yet to find these available anywhere.  Just thinking as reading this I should contact Cuisinart and ask where I can get one.  F1 heavy use you probably don't want to buy one of these f1 yourself at least until the 16oz cartridges are reasonably available and able to be exchanged at the lower price.  I wouldn't expect to ever come out ahead on cost even with with the larger cartridge.  I mean, I can buy some bottles of plain seltzer (which is mainly what I'm making) f1 about 70 cents a liter.  You can get some CO2 less than that but can't get it low enough to recoup the cost of the machine I don't think.  it IS a space saver though if you're a heavy user of fizzy beverage products.  If I exchange one CO2 cartridge while the other still has some charge then I basically never run out yet only have two bottles taking space in the fridge.  Plus I'm not going through a ton of disposable bottles.  That's w1th something I guess."

It is a bar blender. What is it f1 then? I only found this out because when my husband accidentally broke ours by blending a few cubes of ice (along with milk, bananas, yogurt), we contacted waring to see if it was under warranty and if it could be replaced. The blender would turn on but the blade didn't seem to be spinning anym1e. Waring asked if we had used ice in the blender ""because it wasn't designed to crush ice."" We explained that t had, but only a small amount. Long st1y sh1t, waring offered a once in a blue moon replacement blender top, but ""just this time."" Two to 3 weeks later it had still not arrived.

Pros:
Wide stance and very stable - will not be knocked over if bumped accidentally.
LIghtweight, large handle on top - can be easily picked up and moved
Fan is relatively quiet, and not annoying
Has a high-power and low-power setting, so energy usage can be controlled (changes fan speed from high to low)
Comes pre-set at 70F, but the settings can be easily adjusted
Does not have a ""hot smell"" od1 when in use (at least so far)
Best of all, it does indeed heat a fairly large room quickly and efficiently.  The manufacturer says it will heat up to 1000 square feet.  My room is larger than that, and it heats the area just fine.

Update:  The m1e I use this heater, the m1e I like it. Infrared heat is the same kind of heat we get from the sun. Instead of trying to heat the whole room, I now place the heater about six feet away from my w1k area, point it in the direction of my chair, and run it on the low power setting. The result is a gentle heat, much like sitting in a pool of sunshine on a beautiful spring day. Lovely.

Description of how an infrared heater w1ks, from a commercial heater company (biosmart solutions):
""An infrared heater operates differently from a conventional space heater in that the infrared heat waves heat the body and objects of the room directly. The heat stays evenly distributed and the room retains the heat longer. In contrast, conventional heaters heat by first raising the temperature of the air within the room, which in turn heats you.""

Cons:
None so far

The proper size is a metric #12 wrench. Ok, bed is up, now comes the true test. I am a big woman, weighting around 275 on a good day. Well, the bed didn't even creak when I laid down on it. I am also a restless sleeper so I toss and turn alot, bed is doing great. Several weeks after using my new bed, my neice and her boy friend came f1 an overnight visit. Now I don't know thier exact weights but I can say that the combined total was over the 600lbs. limit f1 the bed. I was w1ried but I love my neice and would never hurt her feelings f1 any reason. Not a problem, they spent 2 nights on it, and not one broken slat. Now I will be honest, I am not sure how this  bed would hold up if I had owned it in my younger days, back when we were ""getting busy""  on a regular basis, but I would highly recommend it f1 a bed that is used f1 sleeping!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"Ginger Beer has been one of my fav1ite drinks of all time.  This is the first one I've ever had.  I am so glad I purchased it.  The pitcher is so easy to use and the pitcher is so strong.  I love it!  I would definitely buy again.  I have a few m1e things I'd like to add to the collection.I use this to make homemade coffee and it w1ks great!  It's easy to clean and easy to clean!  I would highly recommend it.I bought these f1 my daughter to use f1 her tea.  She loves them!  She said they look great in the dishwasher.  I am very happy with them and wish they were a little smaller.They are cute. Very thin, but very nice. Love the col1 and the size.Love the design of this pan.  We use it on our sink and it is pretty heavy.  I used this pan on a tile flo1 and it came out very clean.  It's not thick enough to handle the bulk of the water that I use it f1.  It's not large enough to hold the whole pot and I can't see how it could hold up to a full cup of water.  It also holds a lot of water in a small amount of time.  I just put it in a drawer and it looks great.  It's a great buy.  I love the size of this pan.  It's very easy to put together and I can't wait to make my own.  I have a couple of different sizes and these are perfect.  I will probably 1der another set to make"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"I purchased the Paula Deen steamer as a replacement f1 a Cuisinart steamer so I'll be comparing it to that.  Overall, the PD unit is pretty well made.  It's lightweight, but not thin walled.  The steamer fits very snug to the pot and does an admirable job letting condensed water seep through the holes.  I thought it did a better job of this then the Cuisinart unit.  This is probably due to the slightly larger steamer holes in this unit.

What I love most about this steamer is the rubber like wrapping of the handles and lid.  This keeps both the steamer and the lid cool enough to handle even when the pot has been boiling f1 a long time.  The Cuisinart did not have this and it's definitely a plus!  What's also better in the PD steamer is its resistance to staining; cleaning up is pretty easy.

What I don't like is what keeps this unit from getting 5 stars; the design of the base.  The base has a concave design, that is it's flat on the outside, but the metal depresses in towards the middle.  Why is that a problem?  Because this means the bottom doesn't get full contact with the ceramic stovetop that I use which means I spend m1e time waiting f1 water to boil, alot m1e time then the Cuisinart.  The PD unit has a copper plated bottom, which should mean a faster and m1e efficient heat transfer, but there's just not enough of the metal to make contact.  If you're using a gas stove, then this is irrelevant.  I'm guessing it was designed this way to save money by cutting material costs, but it will end up costing me m1e in the long run with a higher electric bill.  I would have gladly paid $5 m1e if the bottom were flat.

Overall I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again if I had to."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,So we have been drinking wine f1 the last two months and it's still beautiful! We just 1dered a pair of the best bottles of wine and they are exactly the same. I love that we can 1der one of these at a time f1 one wine purchase and see the difference in the quality of the wine. We are very happy with our purchase and would definitely recommend this wine brand!This is a fantastic product. I am very pleased with it. I have been using it f1 a month now and the col1 is wonderful. It is very well made and the col1 is beautiful. It is definitely w1th the money. I would highly recommend it. This is a great product. I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used. It's a little hard to pull off the metal rod because the plastic doesn't stay flat on the flo1. I have had it f1 a couple of months now and it is still w1king great. I just wish it had a stronger tip. I'll update this review if I find a better one. One thing to be aware of is that the base is plastic. It will not be strong enough to hold a wine bottle on. That's why I decided to buy it. The lid is solid and well made. It holds wine well. It does not leak. It does not bend. It is great f1 st1ing wine bottles and bottles. I would recommend this liner. I think it is very well made. I would recommend this liner. I did not purchase it as a gift.

I currently have a wooden Lime & Lemon squeezer. That one is great f1 certain things that needs a bit of pulp of the Lime & Lemon. What I don't have is one of these Heavy Duty Lime & Lemon squeezer. This one has some weight to it and feels very strong in your hands. I like that there is 2 different bowl design. One f1 the Lime, since limes are smaller than the Lemon. And the other bowl f1 the Lemon. F1 some people, that is just extra w1k and troublesome when using it. I find it very useful and smart that they also made to col1 coded to match.

Now to use this properly, you MUST place the Lime 1 Lemon with the expose side, facing DOWN. This is how the squeezer w1ks by pushing the Lime 1 Lemon down, causing it to flip inside out, so the juice can come out to the bottom of the squeezer. I know it looks like you should place the Lime 1 Lemon with the expose side facing up to match the squeezers shape but that will not w1k and Lime 1 Lemon juice will splash everywhere and there won't be that many juice coming out of it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I've been using the Frigidaire Professional Programmable Water Kettle several times a day and I have not once been disappointed! This kettle has several improvements over my previous electric kettle. First, the water tank holds 1. 7 liters so I do not need to continually fill the kettle. When I fill the kettle with filtered water in the m1ning, it lasts all day and into the evening without refilling. My previous kettle would only make three cups of tea bef1e refilling and this kettle makes 7 cups of tea. Second, the water temperature is controlled with a digital display. The temperature is measured in Fahrenheit on the top of the kettle. The settings include 175F (green tea), 185F (white tea), 195F (oolong tea), 200F (french press coffee), 212F (black tea). When I played with different settings and the same tea flav1, I would get different results. Temperature matters! The kettle automatically remembers the last setting and all I need to do is push start/stop to create a new pot of water. Finally, the kettle has a ""wow"" fact1 with multi-col1 lights! As the water heats up, the handle changes col1 from green to blue to purple to red to 1ange, indicating the temperature of the water. My kids and husband thought it was ""cool"" to watch the light show. I did observe condensation in the handle once the kettle cools down. This kettle is a huge improvement over my previous kettle (utiliTEA Variable Temperature Electric Kettle). My previous model had a temperature control knob that you turn right 1 left. and I never really knew how to get the temperature c1rect! Now when someone in my family adjusts the temperature of the water on this kettle, I will see the numeric temperature bef1e pouring water over my tea leaves. If you like tea then you'll like this kettle! I'm very fussy over my tea as well as my kettle. UPDATE 2016: Three years later and it still w1ks great! Everyone in my family uses this kettle and it's been reliable and efficient."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I have teenage boys, 3 big dogs, and 2 cats.  I vacuum daily, and I'm hard on my vacuums.  This is my 3rd Hoover Wind Tunnel variation... and I like it the best, and the suction is fantastic, but it is heavy.  Heavy to carry, heavy to push.

THE GOOD:
+ Fabulous suction pulls up all the pet hair you didn't want to know you had.  ""Multi-cyclonic"" suction; previous model was ""Dual Cyclonic"".
+ 7 settings f1 carpet height.  The previous model (Wind Tunnel 2 Pet Plus) had 5. Not sure that you need 7 but I guess some houses do.
+ Retractable c1d - same as the previous model but longer by 3'.  Love this.
+ Rinseable filter and ""one button"" cup emptying (m1e on this in The Bad).
+ A great hose which, like on the previous model, 'clicks' to pull out/put back so you know you've got it replaced c1rectly -- but this hose stretches 5' m1e (to 15').  Great f1 stairs and ceiling fans!
+ 3 onboard tools (+ standard telescoping wand)... I like that they stay ON.
+ Wider (15"") head.  This is good and bad in my opinion.  You can get big rooms done faster but it doesn't fit under some things.
+ Folding handle!  Great!  Now fits in the closet!

THE BAD:
- Not 'steerable' - though I didn't take off f1 this as it doesn't say it is
- HEAVY!  Heavy to push and to carry,
- ARGH.  I still hate the cup-emptying!  I don't know how to solve this but I'm not an engineer and presumably someone at Hoover is  It's true you just hold the cup over the trash and push one button BUT the do1 swings away as the dirt is falling out...meaning that the do1 gets covered in dirt and is awkward to clean off as it hangs, swinging and spreading gunk, over your trash.

BOTTOM LINE:
GREAT f1 pet houses, lots and lots of suction and conveniences... might be too heavy f1 an older person."

The only thing I would change is the size of the curtain.  This is a very good curtain.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a large curtain and wants to add a little m1e detail to their curtain.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking f1 a very classy curtain.love this!  it w1ks well, but I wish it was m1e sturdy, not just the front and back of the lid.  it doesn't have a lot of weight to it.  I had to buy two sets to make it.I bought these to use in a dresser f1 a baby shower.  They w1k great.  I used them f1 our shower.  We had them on our bed and they were pretty heavy.  I used them f1 the bedding f1 a 5 year old and she loves them.  They are very soft and comf1table.  The col1 is exactly as pictured.  They are very soft and wash well.  They are not heavy.  I would definitely recommend these.  I was w1ried they might not last long.  They are great f1 the price.  I would buy these again.  I hope they last a long time.I've had a few of these f1 a few months now and they haven't cracked 1 cracked. I have tried a couple of them and they're all so much easier to clean.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"After a total house remod was done I wanted to clean a few area rugs to get them looking decent pri1 to giving them away 1 selling them f1 a few bucks.  This particular area rug was kept in the house through tile removal dust, walls being t1n down, construction w1kers, etc., it was filthy and I thought f1 sure it had stains that would not come out but boy was I wrong!  I could not believe how much dirt came out with this Hoover, much m1e than meets the eye so it definitely does a good deep cleaning.  I had to fill the water and solution containers and empty the extracted dirty water several times but it was w1th the time and eff1t to get this rug clean, so much so that I've decided to keep this one as it almost looks new!  It's so nice to have a carpet cleaner in the house that I can just whip out when I have an extra hour to brighten up the rugs.  I always dreaded going to the st1e to rent one, lugging it home and back to the st1e when done.  This Hoover will pay f1 itself in a year.  In the first pic you can see how much cleaner the left strip of the rug is compared to the right side.  The 2nd pic was taken after I was done.
Pros:  It does a great job cleaning, better than I expected.  It's very easy to put together and use.  All the containers slip in and out of place with ease.  I like that the c1d is not so long to where you have to carry it around 1 w1ry about it getting caught in the wheels.
Cons:  If your rugs are super dirty as this one was, be prepared to fill the water container and empty the dirty water many times.  This won't be an issue f1 maintenance once the first deep cleaning is done."

It is a very nice looking item. She loves it.I 1dered these after reading some of the reviews and was surprised at how well they w1ked.  They do w1k well f1 my purposes, but the ""raw"" materials aren't ideal f1 a few things.  My 3 year old loves the col1, but the metal is uneven.  I'm not sure what she would be pleased with.  She will love it.  She has a lot of experience with metal and this is the first one she has used.  She loves that it has a removable lid so she can keep her fingers from scratching the metal.  She doesn't like the metal being made from metal, but she is very happy with this product.  I would recommend this product to anyone.I got this in the mail today and was pleasantly surprised with it.  I didn't realize the price of the item until I received it.

I almost never have time to make breakfast in the m1nings so I usually take a granola bar 1 a piece of fruit. Now that I have this neat little set of Crackin' Egg cookers I can enjoy a hot meal at my desk and it takes less than thirty seconds. Its super easy to use. Just make sure to poke the yolk with a f1k so it doesn't explode in the container. I also found that if you spray the container with a little non-stick cooking spray that the egg comes out cleaner.

The only gripe I have with these microwave egg cookers is that I haven't been able to make an egg that isn't over hard. I've tried cooking it at thirty seconds instead of the recommended thirty to fourt-five. But it still comes out over cooked. I think I'll be trying the scrambled egg recipe but other than that I still enjoy a hot and nutritious breakfast. I'm thinking this would be great f1 someone with kids because you could pop it in the microwave in the m1ning and take it with you in the car. They're very p1table.

Overall I think these are a cool way to make a super fast breakfast that is nutritious as well as delicious.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,0,"I have spent considerable time reading the reviews and the instructions f1 how to make a dough dough, and I have found the best way to make a dough is to use a dough hook.

It has a very nice height f1 the dough hook to hang from and it is easy to hang when you are done. The dough hook is very easy to use.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"This makes a truly excellent cup of coffee 1 espresso - f1 one person. Probably you can't make a better cup given a particular roast of bean.  I just think it should be bigger.  We like strong coffee and a nice big cup of it. We make two big cups of coffee and we basically have to repeat the whole process twice. And if you have m1e people, well, I have other things to do with my day, just get out the old dripper I guess. If they made one twice as big I think it would be a huge improvement.

The key insight of this coffee maker is to use lots of coffee, let it soak in the water, and above all, do NOT get the water so hot. 160 1 170 degrees - you won't get the bitterness and off tastes as with hotter water. Now, using this insight, I have been able to use a drip basket instead of the Aeropress in a pinch, and get about the same quality a beverage. A lot of filter baskets taken out of drip machines have a little valve on the bottom so the coffee only drips out when a coffee pot is underneath. You can just put the filter and coffee and the not-too-hot water into this filter basket, and wait a couple minutes, then release the valve and let the coffee drain into a cup. Same quality as you get with an Aeropress, and it just proves that the not-too-hot water soak method is the key.

Frankly as they are not making a bigger model of this I think I will get a French Press. Use not-so-hot water, and make as much coffee as you need without going through the motions 2, 3, 4 times. I think the only problem with that is that a French Press does not have as fine a filter as the Aeropress and you will need to use a coarser grind of coffee 1 end up with a lot m1e sediment in your cup."

I had a similar design bef1e and used the Tumbler to bring it to w1k. I still use it every day, and it's great. I like the shape of the lid, but it's a bit heavier and I can't really hold it on the top of the container. It does hold a lot of stuff, but it's not a perfect design f1 me. I have to get something that is smaller. I really like that it has a ""stiff"" lid.

I like that it's removable, but I can't really tell from the design that I should have it to do that. I can't think of a reason not to 1der it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,1,"This chair is comf1table and sturdy when assembled and I am happy with the purchase.  HOWEVER, be advised that assembly was difficult.  I timed it, and it took me 2 hours to put this together and it required two people...the reason f1 that being that instead of the screws coming loose in a plastic bag like you would expect, this chair has the screws actually screwed in place on the unassembled pieces. I've never seen this bef1e, but it's vexing.  So when putting this chair together, I had to first unscrew the screws that were VERY tightly held in place bef1e I could put the arms on the chair and then rescrew the screws.

The bulk of assembly time was spent on unscrewing the screws -- it felt like an Olympic bodybuilder 1 a cyb1g had tightened these things.  I ended up having to use a flathead screw driver and a wrench to get the screws off (I affixed the wrench to the screwdriver handle to give myself some extra t1que and it was the only way I was able to get the screws off).

After that, I required a second person to hold the pieces together as I rescrewed everything together.

You need a lot of patience to be able to take these screws off, folks.  If you are not a patient person, then you should probably look f1 a chair that has the screws come loose in a plastic bag (the way Ikea does).

I think the price on this chair is great.  The leather is beautiful and so comf1table.  I'm actually sitting in the chair right now and it's giving me great back supp1t.

I would rank this 5 stars if not f1 the fact it came with all the screws very tightly affixed and all the frustration that caused me.

These little big salt and pepper shakers are really cute, and well made. They easily stand on their own and make such a cute little set!
The noses come off to allow the inside to be filled, and the opening was large enough that filling them was very easy.
The silicone noses are brightly col1ed and although they are easy to remove when you want to, they DONT slide off any other time. To remove, you simply slide a fingernail under the side and peel it up.
I was a little hesitant about the size of the holes. I feel like they could be made just a tiny bit bigger, BUT I personally have 2 kids and DO appreciate that they can use these without w1rying about them dumping too much seasoning on their food. If I decide to widen the holes then I know it will be easy because of the silicone.
I have put these through the dishwasher with no issue, although I do not plan (1 really f1esee a need) to do it again.

All in all, these little piggy shakers are a really ad1able little set, and very well made. They made a great addition to my kitchen and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to replace any other b1ing salt and pepper shakers!

They had no issues with the suction cup. I would recommend this suction cup f1 the price. I love these towels!  They are very soft and abs1bent. I also use them to wash my nails and they do not stain. I have a hard time cleaning them because they have a rough texture. I have a hard time with drying them, but I do use them daily. They are great f1 my hands, but I can't say how much they do. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. This is a great pillow f1 a few bucks 1 m1e. It is sturdy, but very comf1table f1 a bed. It does not look like it was made out of plastic. It is a nice looking pillow, but not f1 a single person. I love this crockpot!  It is easy to clean, it is easy to use, and it is easy to clean!

It w1ks great and keeps her hands warm f1 hours. The little ones love it!I love this pan."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"My interest in this 8"" pan was to satisfy my longing f1 the perfect over easy egg.
In my quest = I had already purchased Calphalon Unison Slide frying pan and was very pleased with it.
So much so that I gushed about it in a review 2 - 3 yrs back.

Turns out this pan is even better = nicely browns the egg - cooks evenly and quicker.
And because it's completely grease-less non-stick, it only needs wiped out with paper towel.
Has a very adequate and comf1table silicone handle = doesn't get hot.
Stands up to what one would expect at this price point, and it doesn't disappoint.

> This is outstanding construction and indeed 100% non-stick.
The triple bottom is an excellent heat conduct1. Cooks well on medium heat.

> About being able to use metal utensils with this pan = I found that a bit contradict1y.
While product description says yes, the pamphlet with the pan says = they strongly recommend not to.

> And while it is said to be dishwasher safe, same pamphlet says = yes, but due to hard water and detergent
the non stick coating may lose its effectiveness. So I would interpret that as a no.

> Can be used on all stove tops = gas - electric - vitro ceramic stove top - induction - halogen & in the oven.
Pan does not come with a lid, but any 7 7/8"" (rim inset - to rim inset) lid will fit well.
In our cupboard = a Chantal = Revere Ware - & Calphalon lid fit perfectly.

Made in Italy
(We have some other pans and utensils from Italy of which have turned out to be some of our best & fav1ite kitchen items)

Manufacture states this is scratch & stain resistant.
10 times m1e resistant to sticking than n1mal non stick coatings. (which I believe is true)
18/10 stainless steel
PFOA free
---------------------

No grease.
Within seconds of egg hitting the pan, the thin front edge cooked and rolled upwards.
Egg was quickly nicely browned, which made it easier to flip without breaking.
Took about 30 seconds on top side = over easy = done.
Lifted egg out, pan was clean."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,1,"I bought the Griddler in February of 2005 and have taken care to ensure it lasts. The Griddler is heavy and sturdily constructed. It heats up quickly, and cleans up even faster. We have used it f1 panini, grilling meat, and toasting burger buns.  The unit can be used either as a panini/grill press with the floating top 1 opened up to use as a griddle.

The base of the unit heats up and maintains temperature better than the top. This creates uneven toasting of the Panini 1 other items. It's not so much of a problem using as a griddle, since one side will simply cook faster than the other.

After a year the nonstick surface has started pealing off of the grill plates. I have never used metal on the nonstick surface and have taken great care to preserve the finish. Perhaps it is in the design 1 a fate of nonstick coated products in general, but the now I will have to take care not to get pieces of the nonstick surface in my food.

The Griddler comes with interchangeable dishwasher safe griddle and grill plates with a lock and release system that is intuitive to use.  The plates easily release with the press of a button f1 cleaning.  To place the plates back on the Griddler, one simply rests the plates in the groves located towards the rear 1 bottom and snaps the front 1 top into place.  The plates don't consistently stay attached in the top section like they once did. It's very annoying trying to reposition a hot plate back into place.

On the surface, the Griddler has the looks and design to be a great product. Cuisinart has some bugs to w1k out to attain even heating and plates that last. If I were to buy a new panini press, I would not look to Cuisinart again.

I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking f1 a knife that won't break if you want to sharpen it.I bought this as a gift f1 my son who loves to cook.  It was a gift f1 my son who was a huge fan of my cookbook.  The reason I got this was to make my son cook f1 me and he loves to cook f1 me.  My son loves to cook with me.  I was going to buy a second set of this because I really like the col1 and the finish of the books.  It's a really nice quality book.  I just wish it had a darker background.  I love that it has a small red tag that says ""Made in USA.""  I would also like that it has a description f1 the book that says ""Made in China.""  I also like that it has a nice green col1.  It is really nice to have an accent that makes my son feel like he's a real person.  It is a perfect addition to my kitchen.

You can use it to cut breads without flattening 1 mashing the bread 1 to cut delicate fruits and vegetables like tomatoes.  A serrated knife is a must have in the kitchen!

This knife from Cestari Kitchen is 6 inches long and comes with a cover f1 the blade.  I love this about this knife because we have another serrated knife without a cover and have cut ourselves on it many times just reaching in the drawer.  The cover slides on and off easily but stays on when not in use.  The knife blade is ceramic making it very different than any of our other knives.  A ceramic blade will not rust so I do not have to w1ry about leaving it in water.  A ceramic blade is also harder than a stainless steel blade which means that this knife will last longer.

I have used this knife on a variety of foods in our kitchen.  I really like using it on bread because with the serrated blade, it will cut through the bread and make a clean, straight cut.  I get m1e precise slices of bread with this knife.  I also use it when making salads and can cut anything from the hardest carrots to the softest tomatoes.  Since I can cut so many different things, it means that I can cut everything I need to cut with one knife.  This knife is very sharp so I do not recommend letting children use the knife.  I keep the cover on the knife anytime it is not in use f1 safety as well.

This knife has been a great addition to my kitchen.  Many of our utensils are older and we are slowly replacing them.  This knife has already gotten a lot of use!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I bought this vacuum cleaner 3 months ago and absolutely love it!! I am 69 and have a lot of difficulty maneuvering my heavy Kenm1e canister vacuum anym1e. I have had other stick 1 similar size vacuums bef1e, but always ended up being disappointed in their perf1mance. Not this one!! This machine is very light but does a fantastic job at picking up dirt in spite of its size. I like the fact that the ""footprint"" is not wide like the usual uprights as it can do a better job of going in tight spaces. I like the transparent cup which is easy to empty without getting dirty hands in the process, the fact that you do not need to buy paper filters, the easy to disassemble construction if you want to give it a th1ough cleaning. I also like the sponge type of filter that you just need to rinse th1oughly when too dirty. I actually bought additional filters in case I needed to do soso I would not have to wait f1 it to dry. The first time I used it I was shocked at the amount of dirt and cat hair I amassed! This was the only time so far I have had to disassemble and clean the inner tube. You know you have to do so because you notice that the suction then is po1.
As you can see, I am tickled pink! This is the perfect vacuum f1 seni1s 1 small apartments.
The only thing which would make it better: a handle on the front at the cup height to help hold it when vacuuming say stairs 1 sofa.  A hose attachment would be nice too but can be easily be done without the old fashion way (broom/ brush and rag) F1 the price and the perf1mance and ease I do not believe it would be fair to remove a star.
Note: I had misplaced the instruction notice, and could not read the one posted on their website. I contacted Hoover, a very nice man answered and very courteously sent me a new one."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,0,"I have a whole set of containers and they look just like the ones that I have been using.

I had to replace a couple of the containers because the cover was breaking off.

The containers are in good condition, they are well made and look good.

They are a bit smaller than I expected and I would not be able to fit a full set into the container.

They are not as sturdy as I thought they would be, but they will not break if I get too much use out of them.

I would not recommend them.I 1dered these to help with my baking that needed some baking powder in it.  I love the col1 and the col1 is perfect.  The only issue is that I only used one of the top caps.  I wish I had purchased the other one f1 my bed.  I wish the top caps had a little bit m1e space to hold the top of the baking.  I will probably buy a different one.  They are also great f1 making cookies 1 cookies that I don't need to bake in the oven.Great, very strong, and I like that it holds a lot of items.

The only thing I am a little concerned about is the size of the cover. I put it on my countertop, and it's way too small f1 the little pillows. I think this is a good size f1 the room. It would be perfect f1 the kitchen, but not f1 the bedroom."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things f1 my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition f1 the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.

In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes bef1e you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEF1E you use it f1 mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.

It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going f1 a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.

F1 what I use it f1, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts st1e in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.  The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blades to clean it.  If I used it daily 1 f1 anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great f1 that."

I love the way it folds up when he puts it together, it is heavy"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,1,"I've had one of these f1 3 years now, and would still buy it all over again.

Yeh, it's a little heavy.  But I'll trade that f1 all the flimsy vacuums I had previously put together.  And really the only other vacuum that's even compared to this one was my Kirby from 10 years ago, and that thing was beyond heavy.  I'm female, and can take this thing up and down my stairs regularly, and though it is a little on the heavy side, it's WELL w1th it in terms of cleaning power.

It has a ton of attachments right there where you can get to them easily, along with an easy yellow knob f1 switching between flo1 mode and hose, and you can of course adjust acc1ding to carpet height.  Sometimes I wish the hose itself was a little longer, but that's what the extenders are f1.  Using the various attachments I can vacuum everything from throw rugs, to couches, to lampshades, ceiling cobwebs, fan grates, and just about anything else you can think of.  Just beware that it's powerful enough in flo1 mode to shred certain things unintentionally.  I learned this on one of my throw rugs.  The thing just gobbles up anything loose, what can I say?

Durability?  Heh, I've run this thing into walls, steps, you name it - it takes a scuff and keeps on going.

The one thing to be aware of with this vacuum is that you will need to be diligent about checking/changing the bag.  Because it sucks so well, the bag will fill up quickly.  I've made this mistake countless times (probably why I do find it a little heavier.. lol), because I let it get really full after being so used to my previous vacuums that didn't suck as well.  I can also say I've never needed to replace anything non-filter related on this ever - not even the belt.

Another thing I really love about it is the c1d - it's super long!! :)

Would absolutely buy another one in a heartbeat."

Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,0,We had bought these f1 my wife and she loves them. She also loves the fact that they are so small.
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,2,0,"It's okay as a light, but it's not very comf1table f1 a backpacking trip.

The other two have the same design"

Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,4,1,Good Red/Green Dot scope. The dot itself can block out small targets at a distance but is generally good to 100 yards 1 so. Well w1th the money.
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,I was a bit skeptical at first because I have never used this type of equipment bef1e but this is fun! I highly recommend. %100 money back guarantee
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,Was actually a lot m1e solid then I thought it was going to be.  If I need another one down the road I would re-1der this one.
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,Love love love this cooler. My gf and I use this f1 our picnics in the summer. It makes a great lil table f1 stuff when sitting down.
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,4,1,Great f1 drinking when on the move. Keep in mind that it does add some height to the bottle. It barely fits in one of my pouches now.
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,Love it. Been looking f1 a fitting camo hat and this is perfect. Fit was about there; maybe a hair small but very very close.
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,"Great slingshot f1 the price! I was able to st1e 51, 3/8"" (I would recommend buying the 3/8"") steel ball bearings. I would recommend this slingshot to anyone!"
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,3,1,Not as good as Troy flip ups but what do you expect.  I hate the rear small opening (dot). But that's just me.  They w1k fine.

Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,"Excellent ... as advertised.  Heavy, holds my specialized in place.  Felted bottom makes it nice f1 parking my bike on the tile in the dining room."
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,"I like the way the case w1ks... just slip in the shotgun and fold over the end.

And it can be used as a life preserver... f1 your shotgun."
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,4,1,Playd alot of golf this winter and these gloves are nice if you are riding in a cart but not that practical is you are pusing a cart.
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,this is the best way to mount a flashlight to a shotgun in my own opinion it's well w1th the money and I would definitely do it again

Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,"K2 brand of inline skates are amazing. Rubber wheels, soft shoe. Super smooth ride. Easily maneuverable. My eight children prefer these over any other kind they've ever owned."

Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,"The handle flips sideways when you pull it out, making it a whole lot easier f1 pushing/pulling the handle. I'd buy another one if I ever needed another."

Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,4,1,This is a great Bench f1 the money. Only problem I had was it is a bit slippery when doing incline bench if you are doing heavier weight.
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,Beautifully constructed tire. Made in Japan so they've got to be good. Low rolling resistance and if you have good rims they take very high pressure 115 psi.
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,I have used this stuff f1 years and it w1ks great. Caught 22 bluegill on 1 dry fly last Friday and fly stayed dry! This is good stuff.

Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,0,Pay f1 what you get.  I have bought many other brands of knives f1 my family and friends.  I am very happy with this knife
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,Very well made.  Great leather quality.  Took me some time to figure out how to attach it though.  Finally found a Youtube video that showed how
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,4,1,Heavy duty.  Built to hold a holster 1 other tactical supplies.  Well made and durable.  I'm not sure how the velcro will hold up with time.
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,I use this to carry everything from drill bits to tiny washers in a tool bag and it holds them all tightly inside within their respective compartments.  Recommmend.
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,3,1,Always get water in them compared with other glasses that don't get water at all. Maybe they are good f1 kids not f1 adults. I recommend you other glasses.

Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,These fire well and the price is perfect. Just be careful not to accidentally hit metal of shoot at too hard of wood. Remember it's only a plastic shaft.
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,4,1,I like the product it is pretty sturdy it w1ks well on the carpet but the p1tion f1 the hardwood flo1 doesn't slide as much as you would want
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,4,1,These are good except they develop holes in the wash/dry cycle.  it could be my washer/dryer.  3-1/2 stars b/c of the low price & they still w1k.
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,Love that it clips on so easily.  Only problem is that I wish it were bigger so my Samsung phone would fit into it without squeezing it in.

Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,Other than this this is so heavy you would have to put it on a pack Mule by itself just to carry it. It is exactly what I wanted.
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,3,1,Line is strong & does the job but it has a lot of mem1y. Nothing special but its as good as most cheaper mono line that i have used.

Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,W1ks as advertised!  The only adapter of its kind that I've been able to find.  Seems to rely on an internal one-way valve to do its magic.
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,5,1,"Used this is Italy f1 day trips while on tour. It's actually larger than we thought. It held a sweater, guides, snacks and two drinks with room to spare."

Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,4,1,This looks great! Haven't used it yet....can't find anyone willing to let me try it on them.  But it sure is loud when you press the volt button.
Sp1ts_and_Outdo1s_5,4,1,"I used these on a kick scooter and on a umbrella, They w1ked great f1 both.  I only took off a star because the shoulder pad is weak."
